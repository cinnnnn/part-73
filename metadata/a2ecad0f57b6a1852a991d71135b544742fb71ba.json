It details the raid one night on an imaginary German town. Both British and German sides of the events are heard, interspersed with recollections from both British and German veterans, who experienced both sides of a raid such as is portrayed.\n\nThe British are not uniformly good and the Germans not uniformly bad, rather ordinary people leading ordinary lives. The finale of the raid is truly horrifying and almost left me in tears.\n\nCompulsive listening.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2ecad0f57b6a1852a991d71135b544742fb71ba","amp;dn":"Bomber+-+Len+Deighton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2ecad0f57b6a1852a991d71135b544742fb71ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,236,173,15,87,182,161,133,42,153,29,113,19,91,84,71,66,251,113,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
