HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also father of Miley Cyrus, one of HollywoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most successful young stars, who grew up on stage and on screen, most famously as the lead on the Disney ChannelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hannah Montana,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ where Billy Ray Cyrus played her father. But sometimes the truth is even better than fiction. Now, for the first time, fans can read about CyrusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tenacious and inspiring struggle to find his own way to faith, family, and the power of music.\n\nHillbilly Heart opens during CyrusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s turbulent childhood in Kentucky, where he sought refuge in music and sports after his parentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ divorce. He was a troublemaker in training, known more for pulling pranks than for following in his preacher grandfatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s much-vaunted footsteps. But when he heard a voice telling him to get a left-handed guitar and start a band, this rebel found his cause. Ten years later, after tirelessly working the club circuit and knocking on the closed doors of music executives from Nashville to Los Angeles, Cyrus finally made a stratospheric breakthrough, becoming a multi-platinum selling artist and taking his rock-and-roll twist on country music to the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stage.\n\nCyrus fans have always been able to piece together the details of his life through his lyricsÃ¢â‚¬â€the ups and downs, adventures and disappointmentsÃ¢â‚¬â€but Hillbilly Heart gives them a front row seat for his most candid performance ever.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:234963f968606680a02c831f3108800db97c996c","amp;dn":"Hillbilly+Heart+by+Billy+Ray+Cyrus+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"234963f968606680a02c831f3108800db97c996c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,73,99,249,104,96,102,128,160,44,131,31,49,8,128,13,185,124,153,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
