Baker. The film is based on a story by Carl Nystrom and stars Maxwell Reed, Dinah Sheridan, Patric Doonan, Kynaston Reeves and Annette D. Simmonds. \n[img]http://www.freeimage.us/image-58B9_53473CB1.jpg[/img]\nWell-tried thriller formula produces the odd moment of creepy atmosphere in the hands of director Robert S Baker. Maxwell Reed and Dinah Sheridan do well in the lead roles.\n\nEngineer Christopher Pelly (Maxwell Reed), a temporarily blind man awaiting an operation to restore his sight, goes into London to visit a friend but is dropped off at the wrong address in Kensington by a mistaken taxi driver. Unable to see, Pelly enters what he believes to be his friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s house and quite literally stumbles into a murder mystery. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a dead body on the floor with a knife in the victimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s back Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and worse still; the three men responsible for the murder are still in the house.\n\nWhen the three murderers realise Pelly is blind, they decide another dead body is unnecessary, and instead cosh him over the head and dump him in the street outside. The police appear sceptical of PellyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story because no corpse is recovered, so after a successful operation to restore his sight Ã¢â‚¬â€œ he sets out to solve the mystery of the dead body. He returns to the scene of the murder and encounters Patricia Dale (Dinah Sheridan), she has lost somebody, her brother Norman, but that was twelve-months ago and his body was never recovered from a plane crash. Pelly and Dale join forces and turn into amateur sleuths.\n\n Starring Maxwell Reed (later to become Mr Joan Collins), Blackout is the story of a blind man who stumbles upon a murder scene but, after regaining his sight following an operation, goes on the hunt for the killers\n\nA bit about Mr Joan Collins,\nIrish-born Maxwell Reed was on stage from 1943. This former seaman appeared in a number of crime dramas playing heroes, victimised males, and villains mostly trading on his film star good looks. Once a member of RankÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Company of Youth, he is now a largely forgotten figure of British cinema except for some recognition as the first husband of Joan Collins. Collins claims she divorced him after he allegedly tried to sell her to an Arab sheik for Ã‚Â£10,000.\nOnly 10,000?\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 884mb\nDuration.... 01:10:18\nCodec.... h264\nFrame Width..... 712\nFrame Height.... 540\nData Rate....1627kbps\nFrame Rate.... 25F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 125kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:766a1a3beb03f94bf57395957d77c3ffd1f77362","amp;dn":"Blackout+1950+DvdRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"766a1a3beb03f94bf57395957d77c3ffd1f77362","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,106,26,59,235,3,249,75,245,115,149,149,125,119,195,255,209,247,115,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
