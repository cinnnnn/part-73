MSNBC has characterized supporters of Cliven Bundy as &quot;insurgents&quot; and has labeled them as members of &quot;Alex Jones-Drudge-Fox News-Rand Paul axis,&quot; an allusion to the Axis powers during World War 2. \n\nAlex also covers remarks by Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky that the Bundy siege is a perfect example of why Americans are getting increasingly angry at the federal governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s outrageous abuse of power. \n\nAlex takes a look at the escalating situation in Ukraine, the possibility the United States government is preparing a military response to a crash of the dollar, and Obama's call for sustained and unrelenting taxation of the American people.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
