Trained to sing by her soprano mother, Clark embarked on a stage career at the age of seven; soon she was a fixture on British radio programs, and began hosting her own regular show Pet's Parlour -- a series spotlighting patriotic songs designed to boost the morale of wartime audiences -- at the tender age of 11. ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:fifqxqw5ldte~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:fifqxqw5ldte~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nThis 29-song EP, clocking in at 77 minutes, is more generously programmed than any other collection of Petula Clark's hits, and it may well delight fans of Clark's voice. On the other hand, those who are admirers of the sound of Clark's familiar mid- to late-1960s' hits may find it rough sailing, because half the material on this disc predates the advent of that part of her career, when Clark was still an adult pop singer in the Doris Day or Rosemary Clooney mold. For real fans, however, it is a veritable celebration of her voice in all of its guises, from 1956's &quot;With Your Love&quot; through &quot;Downtown&quot; (which appears right at the track 15 spot here), to 1967's &quot;Don't Sleep in the Subway.&quot; The stylistic range of this material will astound casual listeners, who only know Clark's post-&quot;Downtown&quot; career. Not all of the material is especially noteworthy -- &quot;Welcome Home,&quot; although nicely arranged and well sung, might as well be a lesser Patti Page recording -- but some of the material does, indeed, command serious attention. The most notable track here, unique on CD to this collection, is Clark's lyrical, slow ballad version of the Honeycombs' hit &quot;Have I the Right,&quot; an extraordinary reinterpretation that could and should have challenged the original. And Clark's cover of the Bacharach-David song &quot;True Love Never Runs Smooth&quot; is a lost '60s pop/rock treasure that was released (in England) in tandem with &quot;Downtown.&quot; Oddly enough, several songs that don't fit in especially well with her album releases on CD work beautifully here, most notably &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; and &quot;Here, There and Everywhere.&quot; Clark's own work as a composer is reasonably well represented, with &quot;Gotta Tell the World,&quot; &quot;Hold On to What You Got,&quot; and &quot;While the Children Play.&quot; The notes are a little sketchy about specific songs, but otherwise, this and its companion volume are a good compromise for fans who don't want to buy the complete Petula Clark reissue catalogs of the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:dnfexqlgldae&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:dnfexqlgldae&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
