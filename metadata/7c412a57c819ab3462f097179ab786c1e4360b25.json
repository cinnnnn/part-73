The film stars Charles Bronson, Robert Hutton, John Carradine, Carole Mathews and Fintan Meyler. \n\nOlive Films has been a real blessing for film buffs anxious to see interesting but sometimes obscure films. Showdown at Boot Hill (195, a Western with Charles Bronson in one of his earliest leading roles, isn't even listed in the filmography section of his Wikipedia page, nor is there an entry for the film itself. It's also not listed in Leonard Maltin's normally thorough iPad app, though it does get a brief mention in his Classic Movie Guide. \n\nA pre-superstardom Charles Bronson plays a US marshal in Showdown at Boot Hill. Tracking down a wanted murderer to a small town, Bronson kills him in a shootout. It develops that the dead man, whose criminal past was unknown to his fellow townsfolk, was a popular and highly respected member of the community. The decedent's friends refuse to identify the body, thereby denying Bronson the opportunity of collecting the reward money. At first angered by this, Bronson is gradually won over to the townspeoples' point of view.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 2.93gb\nDuration.... 01:12:01\nCodec.... h264\nFrame Width..... 1280\nFrame Height.... 544\nData Rate.... 5727kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 102kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 44KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c412a57c819ab3462f097179ab786c1e4360b25","amp;dn":"Showdown+at+Boot+Hill+1958+BrRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c412a57c819ab3462f097179ab786c1e4360b25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,65,42,87,200,25,171,52,98,240,151,23,154,183,134,193,228,54,11,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
