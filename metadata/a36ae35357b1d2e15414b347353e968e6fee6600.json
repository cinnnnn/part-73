Simmons attributes his meditation practice with changing his life for the better and says that there is no Ã¢â‚¬Å“badÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ way to meditate, only different forms for different people.\n\n\n\nIn this highly anticipated new book, Russell Simmons guides readers into finding greater clarity and focus, and explains how to be healthier in both mind and body. Simmons breaks down what he's learned from masters of meditation into a guide that is accessible to those unfamiliar with the practice.
