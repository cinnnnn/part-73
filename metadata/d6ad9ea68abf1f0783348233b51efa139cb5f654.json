This book argues that as a researcher, public lecturer, and scientific popularizer, Tyndall had a sizable impact on the establishment of the scientist as an authoritative figure in British culture. As a promoter of science in education and one of the foremost advocates of freeing scientific study from the restraints of theology, Tyndall was both a celebrated and a notorious figure, who influenced areas of Victorian society from governmental policy to educational reform to the debates over Darwin's theory of natural selection. In contextualizing Tyndall's varying fields of research and involvement, DeYoung explores many different aspects of nineteenth-century culture, including the development of public science, the role of popular media, and the growth of university research. It engages with the latest scholarship on Victorian culture and the history of science while at the same time exploring the reasons for Tyndall's heretofore neglected reputation. This book establishes John Tyndall as an important and influential figure of the Victorian period whose scientific discoveries and philosophy of science in society are still relevant today.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6ad9ea68abf1f0783348233b51efa139cb5f654","amp;dn":"A+Vision+of+Modern+Science%3A+John+Tyndall+and+the+Role+of+the+Sci","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6ad9ea68abf1f0783348233b51efa139cb5f654","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,173,158,166,138,191,31,7,131,52,130,51,181,30,250,19,156,181,246,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
