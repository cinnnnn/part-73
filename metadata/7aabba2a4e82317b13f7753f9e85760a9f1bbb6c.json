Cleaved in two, he is brought back to life with cyber-technology. Brandishing his ninja sword and the mecha weapons in his cyborg arm, he slaughters zombies with brutal, over-the-top abandon.\n\nStep into a stylized living comic book where stunning graphics depict a world gone mad. Hordes of undead can only be stopped by YAIBAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s willingness to use any means necessary to get the job done. Will he kill by turning his cyborg arm into a razor chainsaw for slicing up undeadÃ¢â‚¬â€or just rip off an opponentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arms to use as zombie nunchucks? Both possibilities fill Yaiba's heart with twisted laughterÃ¢â‚¬â€and the desire to kill more and more zombies!
