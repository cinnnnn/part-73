Although there is a throwaway &quot;Maynard Ferguson Hit Medley,&quot; such pieces as &quot;Blue Birdland,&quot; &quot;Cherokee&quot; and &quot;But Beautiful&quot; better showcase the remarkable trumpeter. The sidemen include Christopher Hollyday on alto. This is an excellent all-round showcase for MF but the CD from the now-defunct Intima label will be hard to find. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Blue Birdland\n02 - Cherokee\n03 - Caught In The Current\n04 - But Beautiful\n05 - Cruisin' For A Bluesin'\n06 - The Maynard Ferguson Hit Medley\n\nSplit with Medieval. Sorry.\nEnjoy and share!
