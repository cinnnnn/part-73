Since the release of their self-titled debut album in 1972, the band has sold over 24 million albums worldwide, including 7 million in the United States alone.[citation needed] The band's music videos, especially &quot;Burnin' for You&quot;, received heavy rotation on MTV when the music television network premiered in 1981, cementing the band's contribution to the development and success of the music video in modern pop culture. Today, BÃƒâ€“C's music continues to be played on AOR-friendly radio stations as well as in movies, television shows, and commercials, and even during sporting events.\n\nBlue Ãƒâ€“yster Cult's current lineup includes long-time members Donald &quot;Buck Dharma&quot; Roeser (lead guitar, vocals) and Eric Bloom (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboard), as well as Jules Radino (drums, percussion), Richie Castellano (keyboard, guitar, vocals), and Kasim Sulton (bass guitar).\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAgents of Fortune is the fourth studio album by the American hard rock band Blue Ãƒâ€“yster Cult, originally released in a gatefold sleeve LP in 1976 through Columbia Records.\n\nThe platinum selling album peaked at No. 29 on Billboard's Pop Albums chart, while the single &quot;(Don't Fear) The Reaper&quot; peaked at No. 12 on the Pop Singles chart,making it Blue Ãƒâ€“yster Cult's biggest hit.\n\nThe band also became a larger concert attraction at this timeÃ¢â‚¬â€largely based on not only their stageshow, but aided by the airplay of &quot;(Don't Fear) The Reaper&quot; which to this day is a staple of FM rock station playlists. Concert venues became larger, the show became more intricate and BÃƒâ€“C was reaching its commercial peak on the tour circuit.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fbd260154b8cf7d886569962938f87be2810e2d","amp;dn":"B.O.C.+-+Agents+Of+Fortune+%5B1976%5D%5B2012%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D%5BRMSTD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fbd260154b8cf7d886569962938f87be2810e2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,189,38,1,84,184,207,125,136,101,105,150,41,56,248,123,226,129,14,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
