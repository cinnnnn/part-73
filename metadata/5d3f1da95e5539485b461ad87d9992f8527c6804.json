The seventy-nine-year-old painter Hope Chafetz, who in the course of her eventful life has been Hope Ouderkirk, Hope McCoy, and Hope Holloway, answers questions put to her by a New York interviewer named Kathryn, and recapitulates, through stories from her career and many marriages, the triumphant, poignant saga of postwar American art. In the evolving relation between the two women, interviewer and subject move in and out of the roles of daughter and mother, therapist and patient, predator and prey, supplicant and idol. The scene is central Vermont; the time, the early spring of 2001.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d3f1da95e5539485b461ad87d9992f8527c6804","amp;dn":"John+Updike+-+Seek+My+Face","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d3f1da95e5539485b461ad87d9992f8527c6804","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,63,29,169,94,85,57,72,91,70,26,216,125,153,146,248,82,124,104,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
