Anatomic Therapy, self treatment for all internal diseases. This DVD includes Total 10 Parts and i have manage to successfully compress in to one single double layer Media. Please do share this to your friends, families, relatives.\n\nWhat is Anatomic Therapy?\nWhen we get a disease, we consult a doctor. All the doctors in the world cure us through various ways such as medicine, tablet, injection, etc. and also using various other methods such as Neurotherapy, Siddha, Mudra, Unani, Pranic Healing, Touch Healing, Acupuncture, Acupressure, Magnet Therapy, Yoga, breathing exercise, meditation, Naturotherapy, Herbal therapy and many other such ways\n\nBut, in our treatment, there is no medication at all. There is no need for any blood test. There is no necessity to check the pulse. We need not take any scan. There is no diet control either. Yet, we can cure the diseases! You may wonder how it is possible. In this treatment, we can cure any disease even without enquiring about the name of the disease and its nature.\n\nGenerally, when we go to a doctor, we describe in detail the nature of our disease to the doctor for at least 30 minutes. The doctor asks us to take several laboratory tests. Finally, a name is given to the disease. Then the doctor prescribes the medication. In most of the cases, the doctor tells us that the disease cannot be cured but can only be controlled throughout our life.\n\nBut, in Anatomic Therapy, we can cure the diseases without the patient telling us anything about his or her disease and also without taking any test at all. You may ask, Ã¢â‚¬Å“What on earth will you do?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ We will talk non-stop for about six hours.\nThe patient has to just listen. That is all the treatment. This is why this treatment is called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Healing by HearingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Again you may ask: Ã¢â‚¬Å“How can a disease get cured just by the patient listening to the speech?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThere is a gland in our body. All the people in the world have this gland. A liquid is secreted by this gland. This liquid cures 95% of all the diseases in the world.\n\nWhat is the name of this gland? Where is it located in our body? What is the name of the liquid secreted by this gland? How does this liquid cure all the diseases? I can tell you all this and more. How to make this gland secrete that liquid? I know this trick.\n\nNow you all know the Secret of life. :)\nPranam ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7de9c005ac22a1a600cd75979020dad6465b89b4","amp;dn":"Anatomic+Therapy+2013+-+Healer%27s+Baskar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7de9c005ac22a1a600cd75979020dad6465b89b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,233,192,5,172,34,161,166,0,205,117,151,144,32,218,214,70,91,137,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
