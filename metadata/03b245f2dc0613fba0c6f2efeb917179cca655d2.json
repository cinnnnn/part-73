Consisting of seven songs, this release doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t intend to follow a unique style, so it flirts with industral, synth pop, jazz and EDM. The idea behind the album came from the necessity of producing something different, but at the same time familiar. The only way to get to this result was to leave any prejudice ideas behind and compose searching for inspiration in any band or musician that we admire.\n\nThe album is entirely DIY, recorded, mixed and mastered really loud in our home studio, from the beginning of 2010 until April, 2014. No detail got out of control, from the first to the last track.\n\nRoutine was made carefully for you. So, appreciate it really loud. :)\n\nOfficial website: http://cyberogre.com.br\nFacebook:\n\n01.
