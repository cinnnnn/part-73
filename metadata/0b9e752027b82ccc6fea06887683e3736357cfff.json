But his life splinters apart when he discovers that, far from leading an ordinary life in a northern town in 2012 as he thought, he has spent his whole life so far in a deliberately induced coma. The year is actually 2024 and a repressive regime is in force: it plans to brainwash the whole population. Set free by the local resistance movement, he finds himself drawn into their struggle; and he gets involved with Kyla, a girl who lives on the streets. But are they all just using him: is there anyone he can really trust?\n\nA nail-biting thriller that never lets the reader relax!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b9e752027b82ccc6fea06887683e3736357cfff","amp;dn":"Cracks+-+Caroline+Green","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b9e752027b82ccc6fea06887683e3736357cfff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,158,117,32,39,184,44,204,111,234,6,136,118,131,227,115,99,87,207,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
