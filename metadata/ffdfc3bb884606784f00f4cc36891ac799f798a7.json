It was a mad, crazy love full of kisses all through the night -- but he broke her heart and she had to move on. Five years later, Kat is finishing her graduate degree and building her business as a jewelry designer, when Bryan, head of his own successful company, walks back into her life. Bryan has been assigned to Kat as her new business mentor and the rules are clear. No hanky panky permitted. Kat can handle that because she's totally over him... right? Except, he still makes her laugh, and he remembers all the things she likes. Not to mention that he's even more handsome now than he was then. Then there's the spark between them -- the simply undeniable chemistry, and the tender ways he shows he still cares for her. Can they resist each other the second time around or will first love trump all?\n\nPretending He's Mine (Caught Up In Us #2) by Lauren Blakely (March 2nd 2013)\n\nOnce upon a time in New York City, there was a down-on-his-luck actor named Reeve, who was talented and gorgeous in that dreamy, broody sort of way that makes all the women swoon. But show biz is a rough biz Ã¢â‚¬â€œ he lost out on a part in a big film, and now his day job hours have been cut too. WhatÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a handsome young thing in need of a role to do? Enter Sutton Brenner. SheÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sexy and shrewd and the most top-notch casting director there is. SheÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s this close to landing a coveted gig casting a film based on a best-selling mega-romance novel, but thereÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a catch. After one too many transgressions with lovely single ladies, the filmÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s philandering producer has been put on a short leash by his wife, whoÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s forbidden him from working with anyone unattached. So the happily single Sutton strikes a pact with Reeve Ã¢â‚¬â€œ play the role of her fiancee until she closes the deal, and heÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s guaranteed to get an audition for the starring role in the film. But as the two play pretend, the lines between make-believe and matters of the heart start to blur. Especially after that hot night in the balcony of the Broadway theater. And that scorching afternoon in the stacks of the New York Public Library. WhoÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s playing who? Or is someone else really the director in the secret affair of their lives?\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffdfc3bb884606784f00f4cc36891ac799f798a7","amp;dn":"Caught+Up+In+Us+Series+%281-2%29+by+Lauren+Blakely+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffdfc3bb884606784f00f4cc36891ac799f798a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,223,195,187,136,70,6,120,79,0,244,204,54,137,26,199,153,247,152,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
