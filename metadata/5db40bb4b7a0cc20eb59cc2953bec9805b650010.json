At the time of its completion in 1973 it was the most expensive series ever made, costing Ã‚Â£900,000. It was produced by Jeremy Isaacs, narrated by Laurence Olivier and includes a score composed by Carl Davis. A book, The World at War, was written by Mark Arnold-Forster, and released in 1973, to accompany the TV series.\n\nSince production was completed, The World at War has attracted acclaim and is now regarded as a landmark in British television history. The producer Jeremy Isaacs was considered ahead of his time in resurrecting studies of military history. The series focused on, among other things, portrayal of the devastating human experiences of the conflict; how life and death throughout the war years affected soldiers, sailors and airmen, civilians, concentration camp inmates and the tragic victims of tyranny.\n\n \n\n\n[b]All files Widescreen[/b]\n \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_at_War&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_at_War&lt;/a&gt;\n \n \n \n \n \n[b]Search for...
