The Vision Forum announcement last week sparked a flurry of discussion both inside and outside the Christian church. The sons and daughters of Belial screeched with glee while the Christians issued more gracious and thoughtful responses.\n\nHere Kevin Swanson takes a look at the wider picture of scandal and outlines a proper response. Fear. Humility. Repentance...all are appropriate for all of us. Take heed, lest you fall. Do remember that everybody is a hypocrite. There are hypocrites who hide their hypocrisy. There are hypocrites who are ashamed of their hypocrisy and repent of it. And then there are those hypocrites who build monuments to their own hypocrisy (we call them &quot;liberals&quot; in this country).\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBiblical UFO's and the Coming Deception:\nChuck Missler discusses what the Bible says about Little Green Men and The Chariots they rode in on.  Here's an opportunity to learn the Alien Agenda Deception from the Biblical perspective.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTestimony of the Ark:\nIn a film by Carl Erik Tengesdal, he presents the importance of the Ark of the Covenant and how the antichrist will set himself in the temple of God as if he was God himself.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDo Modern Translations Contain Pagan Words?\nWill Kinney presents more studies on comparisons of the King James Bible and the various modern translations.  Have meanings been changed?  This teaching video discusses the growing trend of personal mysticism among many modern day professing Christians who do not believe in the inerrancy of the Bible (ANY Bible in ANY language) and have instead opted to follow their own imaginations and personal experiences to define who their god is and what he is like.  See Undeniable Proof the ESV, NIV, NASB, NET, Holman etc. are tne &quot;new&quot; Vatican...\n\n&quot;Behold, the days come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD.&quot; Amos 8:11\n\n&quot;He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.&quot; Luke 8:8\n\n&quot;But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.&quot; 1 Cor. 14:38\n\nNo Bible is My Final Authority, God is! by Will Kinney\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Blessings of Persecution:\nVOM's Todd Nettleton was invited to speak at his home churchÃ¢â‚¬â€First Wesleyan Church in Bartlesville, OKÃ¢â‚¬â€last Sunday as the church dedicated all three morning services to learning about and praying for persecuted Christians.\n\nThis video is from the second of the three services.\n\nChurches in the US and around the world will commemorate the International Day of Prayer for the Persecuted Church (IDOP) on the first Sunday in November. The Voice of the Martyrs provides many resourcesÃ¢â‚¬â€including a short filmÃ¢â‚¬â€to help your church plan for IDOP and effectively &quot;Remember those in bonds&quot; (Heb. 13:3) on this important day. Access all of the resources and learn more about IDOP at www.Persecution.com/IDOP.\n\nLearn when a VOM speaker is coming to your area or request one at www.VOMMeetings.com.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Truth About Israel:\nWhy does Israel exist and what is their imprtance?  \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAl Qaeda Expands, Israel Perseveres - February 4, 2014:\nOn this week's edition of &quot;The Watchman,&quot; we analyze the global growth of Al Qaeda and its affiliates in the face of Obama administration denials. Plus, we sit down with Jerusalem-based author Lela Gilbert to discuss her new book, ...\n\nNote that in this discussion on Israel there is an extreme coorelation between Israel and the modern church.  Both accept anf somewhat fear God, but neither are willing to fully give themselves over to full obedience in His righteous ways.  Whether because they simply don't feel some laws are necessary or worthy to follow, or just too hard to uphold.  Regardless the EXCUSE, both have been lacking the repetence to counter the rebelliousness within their communities and God is giving them over to the Heaven.  Please wise up and listen to &quot;those with ears, let them hear.&quot;  Time is running out with God's patience for His people.  Soon things will explode (Psalms 83) followed by a few decades of troubling times (a woman's labor pains during pregnancy, which has already begun but will soon greatly increase).  Don't be left in the dark and repent.  God's 10 commandments are a reflecting of His eternal word and character, stop pretending otherwise and get into His good graces before its too late!\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSigns - Part 47:\nA compilation of various short clips presenting recent apocalyptic signs occurring around the world today and help us identify the state of affairs ushering the end of days.

Now she knows.\n\n[size=18][color=red][b]JESUS:[/b][/color][/size] Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n[size=18][color=red][b]RAPtURE[/b][/color][/size] [size=12](My transportation outta here).[/size]\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,[color=firebrick]  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...[/color]hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\n\nMay Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.   \n\n[i]Do Not believe anything you find here, search the Scriptures daily to determine the TRUTH.
