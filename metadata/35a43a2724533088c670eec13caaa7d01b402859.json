This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nThere is a song in this countdown (by an American artist) that was sent to Casey several years prior by a New Zealander asking Casey to play it then. Casey wrote back saying he couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t play it because it hadn't made the countdown. Now Casey plays a portion of the original.\n\nThe Jackson 5 has their 16th hit record in a row with &quot;I Am Love (Part 2)&quot; at number 34.\n\nCasey plays a montage of hits by Neil Sedaka (because he is at number 33 with &quot;Laughter In The Rain&quot;), who already had a successful chart career in the late 50s and early 60s before British artists covered the American charts with a different sound.\n\nThe artist, who has had more hit records than any other in the rock era, has his 58th song in the countdown.\n\nCasey tells about Tommy James, an artist who was able to hit the charts from 1966 to 1969 with songs in the styles of bubble-gum music, psychedelic rock, social-commentary records, and good old basic rock and roll.\n\n40:    Snokeroo - Ringo Starr\n39:    Sally G - Paul McCartney &amp; Wings\n38:    Please Mr. Postman - The Carpenters        \n37:    Don't Take Your Love From Me - The Manhattans     \n36:    Mandy - Barry Manilow     \n35:    Shame, Shame, Shame - Shirley &amp; Company    \n34:    I Am Love (Part 2) - The Jackson 5\n33:    Laughter In The Rain - Neil Sedaka\n32:    Never Let Her Go - David Gates\n31:    Sad Sweet Dreamer - Sweet Sensation\n30:    Lovin' You - Minnie Riperton\n29:    Get Dancin' - Disco Tex &amp; The Sex-O-Lettes    \n28:    You Are So Beautiful - Joe Cocker\n27:    My Boy - Elvis Presley\n26:    To The Door Of The Sun (Alle Porte Del Sole) - Al Martino\n25:    Movin' On - Bad Company\n24:    Up In A Puff Of Smoke - Polly Brown\n23:    Poetry Man - Phoebe Snow\n22:    Boogie On Reggae Woman - Stevie Wonder\n21:    Doctor's Orders - Carol Douglas\n20:    Express - B.T.
