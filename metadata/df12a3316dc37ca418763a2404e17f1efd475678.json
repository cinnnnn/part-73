It's easy to see why - the production is commercial without being slick, the songs are balanced between aching ballads and restrained honky tonk numbers, and Jones gives a nuanced, moving performance. It's mature country, both in the laid-back approach and subject matter, but that doesn't mean it's dull - like the best country music, these are lived-in songs that are simple, direct, and emotionally powerful, even with the smooth production.
