Using interviews with survivors and scholars to supplement rare photographic evidence, it established that the terror famine was deliberately created by the Soviet Government as part of Stalin's decades-long effort to destroy the Ukrainian peasantry, who resisted the forced collectivization of their lands. Since it's original release, it has received many international awards (including an Academy Award nomination), and has been featured on William F.
