I managed all the things in this ROM to have a beautiful UI without sacrificing the speed and battery life. This rom is a stock ICS .587 based custom ROM, for our 2011 HDPI Xperia devices, which is heavily customized to look like the upcoming Xperia Z. The base framework of ROM is highly customized to have an awesome GUI, services of this ROM are supercharged to make it super-fast ROM for gaming and multitasking experience and several tweaks extends the backup of phone. Since this rom looks like Xperia Z (to some extent) and has several Jelly Bean and ICS features and apps, thus I named it as Zelly Cream ROM. This rom has Smart Settings, LockScreen Style app and my latest feature Boost My XperiaÃ¢â€žÂ¢. So forget those laggy ICS days, install my ROM, sit back and fly high with your phone.\n\nROM based on ICS .431/.587\n\nHighly customized rom by AROMA installer.\n\nSuper fast, super stable and great battery life without sacrificing UI.\n\n100% bloatware free ROM.\n\nCWM ready and pre-rooted ROM.\n\nLatest Super User binaries\n\nMagnification Glass Ported\n\nDownload Music Info for both Boot loader\n\n360 degree rotation added\n\nSkip track by volume keys\n\nKill app by back button\n\nExtended Power Menu\n\nAdded Hosts List to Block Ads\n\nInit.d support.\n\nSuperCharged services with Time Killer Killer mod.\n\nButterly smooth interface (try and experience by yourself).\n\nLatest Adreno libs.\n\nLatest Xperia T Jelly Bean messaging app with dual UI.\n\nLatest Xperia T Jelly Bean keyboard.\n\nLatest Xperia T Jelly Bean notes apps and walkman widget.\n\nLatest Xperia T Jelly Bean media apps.\n\nLatest Xperia T Jelly Bean media libs for better video and sound quality.\n\nLatest Cyber-shot mod\n\nXperia T Jelly Bean small apps.\n\nWiFi-Direct port(partially).\n\nDual lockscreen support (JB and NXT lockscreen).\n\nJelly Bean lockscreen (slightly modded by me to suit my rom).\n\nJelly Bean easteregg (shows rom name).\n\nJelly Bean Google Play and Gmail app.\n\nXperia Z themed framework for awesome user interface.\n\nXperia Z styled SystemUI with centered clock.\n\nXperia Z default themes.\n\nXperia Z default wallpapers.\n\nLatest LockScreen StyleÃ¢â€žÂ¢ app.\n\nRAM tweaks to get 100-120 mb free RAM always (for great multitasking).\n\nNew Boost My XperiaÃ¢â€žÂ¢ feature to boost your rom to play HD games.\n\nAnd many more, explore by yourself\n\n* Aroma Features\nQuote:\n\nDevice selection\n\nLauncher selection [ Xperia Z | Xperia GX | Xperia Z AdvancedLauncher]\n\nBoot Animation selection [Xperia T Jelly Bean | Nexus]\n\nFont selection [Jelly Bean | Xperia S | Stock | Ubuntu]\n\nLockscreen Selection [Xperia Z | Xperia T]\n\nKeyboard Selection [ Jelly Bean | Stock]\n\nRingtone selection [Zelly Cream | Stock]\n\nRoot app [Super User | SuperSU]\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional features in Aroma (install if required)\n\nRoot Browser Lite\n\nTitanium Backup\n\nTask Killer\n\nFacebook Integration\n\nSocial Engine Core\n\nSony Timescape\n\nQuick Pic\n\nSim Tool Kit","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8be30219e05d910b35484032d7a3c38d2983d0be","amp;dn":"zelly+cream+rom+for+xperia+2011+device","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8be30219e05d910b35484032d7a3c38d2983d0be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,227,2,25,224,93,145,11,53,72,64,50,215,163,195,141,41,131,208,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
