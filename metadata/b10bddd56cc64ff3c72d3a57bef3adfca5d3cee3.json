First and foremost it should be said that in all seriousness, the sound is great; it's big, responsive, widely dynamic, and crisp. It wouldn't be true to say that you wouldn't be able to tell that the recording is from 1962; the rather dry ambience of the original recording, it's somewhat limited stereo spectrum, and momentary distortion gives that game away. Nevertheless, this is as multi-dimensional and present as anyone can imagine a 1962 master tape of orchestral music might sound. The album itself, however, is rather an oddity; French conductor RenÃƒÂ© Leibowitz leading the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra through the two best-known orchestral pieces of Mussorgsky, Pictures at an Exhibition in Ravel's standard edition, and A Night on Bare Mountain in a version that's anything but standard. Although the notes claim that this version was executed by Leibowitz himself &quot;after extensive research of all the available Mussorgsky and Rimsky-Korsakov material,&quot; it strongly bears resemblance to Leopold Stokowski's version of around 1940, and he, too, claimed to have consulted the original sources. It's certainly not the same as Stokowski's, but it is compiled with the same attitude: it's basically the Rimsky-Korsakov version with a lot of added stuff; percussion instruments are brought up front, there's even a hint of wind machine between the end of the witches' Sabbath and the opening of the &quot;Matins bell&quot; conclusion. Thankfully, apart from some weird rebalancing of wind and percussion parts, Pictures at an Exhibition is not similarly tricked out; it's a decent -- and very French -- performance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b10bddd56cc64ff3c72d3a57bef3adfca5d3cee3","amp;dn":"Rene+Leibowitz+%26amp%3B+Royal+Philharmonic+Orchestra+-+The+Power+Of","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b10bddd56cc64ff3c72d3a57bef3adfca5d3cee3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,11,221,213,108,198,79,243,199,45,58,87,190,243,173,252,165,211,206,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
