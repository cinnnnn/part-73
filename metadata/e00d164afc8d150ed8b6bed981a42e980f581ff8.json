We're just attacking in another direction...\nConsidered by most as one of the greatest Korean War films ever made. A U.S. Marine battalion headed by Lt. Col. Steve L. Corbett and Capt. Paul Hansen must fight its way out of a frozen mountain pass despite diminishing supplies, freezing temperatures and constant attacks by overwhelming numbers of Chinese and North Korean soldiers. \n\nThe stellar cast includes Russ Tamblyn in his first &quot;adult&quot; role, future-director Lamont Johnson, and real-life war hero Peter Ortiz, one of the most decorated Marine officers of World War II. Directed by legendary filmmaker Joseph H. Lewis (The Big Combo, Gun Crazy).\n\nRetreat, Hell! is out of favor with most disciples of director Joseph H. Lewis, partly because it was a major-studio release, whereas Lewis' cult classics were made on shoestring budgets for independent producers. Despite this &quot;handicap,&quot; Retreat, Hell! holds up beautifully when seen today.\n\nVery good through and through, Retreat, Hell! is a mini-discovery well worth seeking out and Highly Recommended. \n\nPeter Ortiz, was the most highly decorated member of the OSS, has a small part in this movie,James Cagney played him in the 1947 movie 13 Rue Madeleine.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 867mb\nDuration.... 01:35:29\nCodec.... divx\nFrame Width..... 988\nFrame Height.... 720\nData Rate.... 1209kbps\nFrame Rate.... 29 F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 60kbps\n1 Channel mono\nAudio Sample Rate.... 44 KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e00d164afc8d150ed8b6bed981a42e980f581ff8","amp;dn":"Retreat%2C+Hell%21+1952+DvdRip+Avi+Lee","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e00d164afc8d150ed8b6bed981a42e980f581ff8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,13,22,74,252,141,21,14,216,182,190,217,129,164,46,152,15,88,31,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
