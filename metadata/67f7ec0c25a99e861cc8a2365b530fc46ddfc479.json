Naturally, the atmosphere is very serious and dominated by Mick Weaver's passionate organ-playing.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMiller Anderson: vocals, guitars\nPeter Dines: organ, acoustic guitar\nMichael Weaver: organ, piano, clavinet, congas\nJames Leverton: bass\nEric Dillon: drums, percussion \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67f7ec0c25a99e861cc8a2365b530fc46ddfc479","amp;dn":"Hemlock+-+Hemlock+%5B1973%5D%5B2004%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67f7ec0c25a99e861cc8a2365b530fc46ddfc479","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,247,236,12,37,169,158,134,28,200,162,54,91,83,15,196,109,223,196,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
