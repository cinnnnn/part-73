On location at the Bundy ranch in Nevada, Infowars reporter David Knight gives the latest update on the criminal government agents who are not only illegally destroying water infrastructure but are also assaulting supporters of rancher Cliven Bundy as well. \n\nInternet security pioneer John McAfee joins the show to break down the real details surrounding the Heartbleed bug and his latest anti-snooping software DCentral1. \n\nStan Deyo, a globetrotting researcher and an advanced propulsion engineer who has held &quot;Above Top Secret&quot; security clearance on government projects, also joins the broadcast to discuss the coming global economic collapse, the suppression of advanced technology by the elite and many other topics.\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
