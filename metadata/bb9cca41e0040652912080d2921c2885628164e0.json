It was released as the fourth track on the self-titled album Franz Ferdinand on 9 February 2004. On 19 April 2004 it was released as a single and reached number eight in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nIn Australia, the song was ranked #50 on Triple J's Hottest 100 of 2004.\n\nThe song is about walking home from Bearsden Academy fantasizing about a better life in the future, telling Terry Wogan about it on UK national television, then being shaken from the fantasy as its own ridiculousness shatters its very existence. The chorus and title started off from a mail conversation with Bob Hardy where he suggested the dark of a matinÃƒÂ©e performance was a utopian environment.\n\nFranz Ferdinand are an indie rock band formed in 2002, and based in Glasgow, Scotland. The band is composed of Alex Kapranos (lead vocals and guitar), Bob Hardy (bass guitar), Nick McCarthy (rhythm guitar, keyboards and backing vocals), and Paul Thomson (drums, percussion and backing vocals). The band first experienced chart success when their second single, &quot;Take Me Out&quot;, reached No. 3 in the UK Charts, followed by their debut album, Franz Ferdinand, which debuted on the UK album chart at No. 3. The band went on to win the 2004 Mercury Music Prize, and two BRIT Awards in 2005 for Best British Group and Best British Rock Act. NME named Franz Ferdinand as their Album of the Year. From the album, three top-ten singles were released: &quot;Take Me Out&quot;, &quot;The Dark of the MatinÃƒÂ©e&quot;, and &quot;This Fire&quot;.\n\nThey were part of the mid-2000s post-punk revival along with Arctic Monkeys and Kaiser Chiefs.\n\nOn 16 May 2013, Franz Ferdinand officially announced their fourth album, titled Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action, along with cover art, track listing, which was released on August 26, 2013.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_of_the_Matin%C3%A9e&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_of_the_Matin%C3%A9e&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/NanafAaFH&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/NanafAaFH&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (16:9) 29.97fps 9800kbps\n   Audio: LPCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD, 16 bit]    \n   Duration: 00:03:33\n\n\nSize info:\n\n HD 16/9 aspect ratio NTSC 854 x 480, which is the default DVD resolution for NTSC 16/9 HD video\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
