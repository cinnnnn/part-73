The million-selling &quot;Snoopy Vs. the Red Baron&quot; was the first and most successful of these novelty records in the fall of 1966, and its follow-up, &quot;The Return of the Red Baron,&quot; also made the Top 40.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-royal-guardsmen-p20273/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-royal-guardsmen-p20273/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Al Campbell):\n\nThis two-fer from Collectables features a pair of out-of-print Royal Guardsmen LPs: Return of the Red Baron and Snoopy for President.
