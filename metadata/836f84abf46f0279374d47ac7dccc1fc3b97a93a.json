Their biggest hit single, &quot;I Want to Know What Love Is&quot;, topped the UK and US Charts among others. They are one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best-selling bands of all time with worldwide sales of nearly 80 million albums, including 37.5 million albums in the United States alone.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHead Games is the third studio album by Anglo American rock band Foreigner, released in 1979. It charted at #5 on the Billboard 200 chart, and has sold over five million copies in the US alone. The albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cover depicts a seemingly upset young woman (portrayed by actress Lisanne Falk) in a men's restroom. The title track and &quot;Dirty White Boy&quot; were the album's big hits, peaking at #14 and #12, respectively. This was the album in which Rick Wills replaced Ed Gagliardi as bassist. It was the band's only album produced by Roy Thomas Baker, best known for producing Queen's classic albums.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonnel:\n\nDennis Elliott: drums, vocals\n\nLou Gramm: lead vocals, percussion\n\nAl Greenwood: synthesizer, keyboards\n\nMick Jones: guitar, piano, keyboards, vocals\n\nIan McDonald: guitar, drums, keyboards, vocals\n\nRick Wills: bass guitar, vocals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:836f84abf46f0279374d47ac7dccc1fc3b97a93a","amp;dn":"Foreigner+-+Head+Games+%5B1979%5D%5B2002%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D%5BRMSTD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"836f84abf46f0279374d47ac7dccc1fc3b97a93a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,111,132,171,244,111,2,121,55,77,71,172,125,204,193,252,59,151,169,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
