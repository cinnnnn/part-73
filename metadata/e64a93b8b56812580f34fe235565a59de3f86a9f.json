Why did high-minded, cultured Catherine choose not to accompany her husband to a grand party on the night of her demise? Why did she dismiss all her servants for the evening and leave the front door unlocked? What had been her relationship with the young man seen frequently by her side at concerts and art exhibits? And what can be done to avenge another terrible crime: the assault on Angeles Castelbranco, beloved teenage daughter of the Portuguese ambassador?\n\nAs an ordinary policeman, Pitt had once entered LondonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grand houses through the kitchen door. Now, as a guest in those same houses, can he find the steel in his soul to challenge the great men of the world with their crimes? The path to the truth takes him in deeply troubling directions, from the lofty world of international politics and finance to his own happy home, where his own teenage daughter, Jemima, is coming of age in a culture rife with hidden dangers.\n\nFull Retail ePub. Calibre and ePub Reader ready. Metadata is up to date. I will upload the rest of the series at a later date.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e64a93b8b56812580f34fe235565a59de3f86a9f","amp;dn":"Midnight+at+Marble+Arch+by+Anne+Perry+%28ePub+Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e64a93b8b56812580f34fe235565a59de3f86a9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,74,147,184,181,104,18,88,15,52,254,35,85,101,165,157,227,248,106,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
