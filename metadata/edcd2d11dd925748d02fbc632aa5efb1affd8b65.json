This is not a story of war, but of retreat. This is a story with no enemy, only an amorphous entity that drops bombs from the skies while terrified young soldiers must find a way to carry out their mission until their very last minutes on that mountaintop. As LIRAZ lays the explosives which would destroy that very same structure that his friends had died defending, he witnesses the collapse of all he's been taught as an officer, and his soldier's mental and physical disintegration. \n\n\nLanguage: Hebrew\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edcd2d11dd925748d02fbc632aa5efb1affd8b65","amp;dn":"Beaufort+2007+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edcd2d11dd925748d02fbc632aa5efb1affd8b65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,205,45,17,221,146,87,72,208,47,188,99,42,165,239,177,175,253,139,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
