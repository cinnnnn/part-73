Amy is excellent and this is certainly a piece of art. Setlist wise, Zero receives a rare and powerful rendition and the bands stage presence is very good throughout.\n\nSetlist:\n\n1. Haunted \n2. Going Under \n3. Taking Over Me \n4. Everybody's Fool \n5. My Last Breath \n6. Farther Away \n7. Even in Death \n8. Zero (The Smashing Pumpkins cover)\n9. Breathe No More \n10. My Immortal \n11. Bring Me to Life \n12. Tourniquet \n13. Imaginary \n14. Whisper\n\nEnjoy! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd3a65513150f2fa00a4e678bc2e05b7caf3dbc1","amp;dn":"Evanescence+-+Live+at+E-Werk+-+Cologne%2C+Germany+%2817.Oct.2003%29+%5B3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd3a65513150f2fa00a4e678bc2e05b7caf3dbc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,58,101,81,49,80,242,250,0,164,230,120,188,46,5,183,202,243,219,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
