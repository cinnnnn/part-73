Here I am using the film as background for the Grateful Dead shows, so it functions as a &quot;music video.&quot;  The audio is high quality, hardly inferior to the CD source.\n\nThis &quot;Trip&quot; is really groovy &amp; I hope everyone enjoys it.\n\nYou can download the Grateful Dead soundtrack as a torrent to burn to CD: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6958448/Grateful_Dead_-_Eureka___Portland_1968&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6958448/Grateful_Dead_-_Eureka___Portland_1968&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Grateful Dead set list for this film &amp; the CD torrent is as follows:\n\nTracks 1-4 recorded at Crystal Ballroom, Portland, Oregon\nFebruary 2, 1968\n\n01 Viola Lee Blues\n02 That's It for the Other One\n03 Clementine\n04 Good Morning Little Schoolgirl\n\nTracks 5-10 recorded at the Eureka Municipal Auditorium,\nEureka, California\nJanuary 20, 1968\n\n05 Clementine\n06 New Potato Caboose\n07 Born Cross-Eyed\n08 Tijuana Traffic Jam (aka Spanish Jam)\n09 Caution (Do Not Stop On Tracks)\n10 Dark Star (fade out)\n\nSource: www.archive.org (2005)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d599ddbb3ebc98fd442f63127f67cd750bc98b76","amp;dn":"The+Trip+%281967%29+-+Grateful+Dead+Soundtrack+edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d599ddbb3ebc98fd442f63127f67cd750bc98b76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,153,221,187,62,188,152,253,68,47,99,18,127,103,205,117,11,201,139,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
