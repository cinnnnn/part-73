Their style has been characterised as progressive rock, although their sound often explored other genres, incorporating elements of styles such as folk, psychedelia, acid, jazz fusion and rock and roll. The band achieved recognition in the United Kingdom through their albums, club and concert tours and appearances at festivals, but were unable to attract the same level of attention in USA.\n\nThe band's rotating membership throughout its relatively short existence led to a diversity in sound throughout their different albums. Family are also often seen as an unjustly forgotten act, when compared with other bands from the same period and have been described as an &quot;odd band loved by a small but rabid group of fans&quot;.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMusic in a Doll's House is the debut album by progressive rock group Family, released on 19 July 1968. The album, co-produced by Dave Mason of Traffic, features a number of complex musical arrangements contributing to its ambitious psychedelic sound.\n\nThe Beatles had originally intended to use the title A Doll's House for the album they were recording during 1968. The release of Family's similarly titled debut then prompted them to adopt the minimalist title The Beatles for what is now more commonly referred to as The White Album due to its plain white sleeve.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b236c92c0ae4bec14c4973dc5c3cf5350a0ba535","amp;dn":"Family+-+Music+In+A+Doll%27s+House+%5B1968%5D%5B2012%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b236c92c0ae4bec14c4973dc5c3cf5350a0ba535","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,54,201,44,10,228,190,193,76,73,115,220,92,60,245,53,10,11,165,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
