March 16, 2006\n\n\nFor 32 years, this achingly beautiful No.6, with Walter's Nos.4 and 9, has ranked among my most treasured Bruckner recordings. It's a dream come true to have it on CD at last. It sounds more glorious than ever in its digital remastering, and the dynamic range seems to have been widened a bit.\n\nAll other recordings emphasize the monolithic aspects of the first movement at the expense of the lyrical. Only Stein strikes the right balance. I have heard no other recording of this symphony which displays so much of warm human heart, yet at all times remains noble. I've owned and discarded a LOT of the other recordings, including Klemperer, Tintner I, Tintner II, Celebidache, Lopez-Cobos, Eschenbach, Davis, Haitink, Chailly, Blomstedt, Wand and Sawallisch. After Stein, Skrowaczewski is probably the best of the lot-I recommend his series highly as a whole. Nevertheless, Stein remains one of only two conductors I've heard who allow the first movement the rubato and subtle tempo changes it needs without insulting the listener's intelligence by making them obvious or mannered. (The other was Heribert Reichert, with an inferior orchestra.) Although Stein knows when to be grand, the slow movement radiates disarming tenderness. Throughout the symphony, tempi and pacing feel absolutely right, and every note carries conviction-you MUST hear this!\n\nOf course, the sensitive playing of the Vienna Philharmonic has a lot to do with the success of this performance. Perhaps part of the secret is that Stein has the good sense to stay out of the way and just let this incomparable Bruckner orchestra play this composer as only it knows how. Do yourself a favor by ignoring the execrations of THE AMERICAN RECORD GUIDE, due, possibly, to their chumminess with William Carragan, a Nowak advocate?
