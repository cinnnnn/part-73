The film stars Ben Gazzara, Stuart Whitman, Ray Walston, Vincent Price and Rod Steiger. It has also been released under the title: Convicts Four.\n\nJohn Resko is condemned to the electric chair at the age of eighteen. It is Christmas and Resko wants to give his baby daughter a new teddy bear. He goes, without money, into a shop and tries to get the shopkeeper to give it to him saying he will pay him later. The shopkeeper refuses, Resko grabs a gun he saw in the till and points it at the man. The shopkeeper lunges at Resko and is shot.\n\nHis older accomplice was executed. ReskoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s head was shaved, and his pant leg slit to place the electrodes. With only 1,200 seconds before his execution, Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt reprieved him. Jurors who felt Resko had been controlled by his accomplice wrote letters to Roosevelt on his beÃ‚Â­half. Resko was instead sent to the prison nicknamed Siberia to serve out the rest of his natural life.\n[img]http://www.freeimage.us/image-A554_5316EDD1.jpg[/img]\nIn 1949, after 18 years in prison, Resko is released. His daughter and granddaughter are waiting when he gets out.\n\nResko went on to marry a childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book author (his first wife had divorced him after his arrest), illustrate books, teach, show and collect art. He continued to work with prisoners and consult with detention centers, sharing the idea that art classes could help provide therapy and rehabilitation. He died at the age of 80.\nJohn Resko had painted his way out.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 1.44gb\nDuration.... 01:45:47\nCodec.... divx\nFrame Width..... 720\nFrame Height.... 416\nData Rate.... 1851kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 103kbps....
