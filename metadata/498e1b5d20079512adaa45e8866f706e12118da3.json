Each expects to be the recipient of a tidy sum. But apart from the local constable (Gaston Moschin) and a few other small awards to the help, the entire estate goes to the favorite daughter (Anna Moffo). No sooner than the will is read, murder is done. First the butler, then several members of the family! The local constable is joined by a Scotland Yard inspector (Lance Percival), who sees it as an open and shut case. However, it does not turn out that way, in this giallo directed by Michele Lupo and also starring Peter Baldwin, Eveline Stewart and Giacomo Rossi-Stewart.\n\n******************\n\n  \n\nSome classy giallo 4 ya.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:498e1b5d20079512adaa45e8866f706e12118da3","amp;dn":"The+Weekend+Murders+%28Concerto+per+pistola+solista%29+%5B1970%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"498e1b5d20079512adaa45e8866f706e12118da3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,142,27,93,32,7,149,18,173,170,69,232,134,111,112,110,18,17,141,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
