Using hairs collected from the motel pillow, the BAU team discover several medications used to treat brain tumors in the killer's bloodstream. Graham surmises that the killer is transforming his victims into guardian angels to watch over him because he is afraid of dying in his sleep. Meanwhile, Crawford's wife Bella (Gina Torres) becomes Dr. Lecter's new patient. She is reluctant to tell her husband that she has terminal lung cancer because he already has too much to worry about. Graham starts to suffer from episodes of sleepwalking and continues to dream about the feathered stag that has been haunting him since the Hobbs case. He confides to Dr. Lecter that the pressure of looking into killer's minds is starting to break his psyche and Dr. Lecter attempts to use this to create a wedge between Graham and Crawford. The angel-maker is tracked to an old farm, but is discovered to have committed suicide and transformed himself into an angel. During the investigation, Crawford realizes the reason for his wife's distant behaviour and promises to help her through her illness any way he can.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab8c8bd4794f6551b6dc8d607962ebca57fa40b1","amp;dn":"Hannibal+S01E05+XviD+%5BJKS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab8c8bd4794f6551b6dc8d607962ebca57fa40b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,140,139,212,121,79,101,81,182,220,141,96,121,98,235,202,87,250,64,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
