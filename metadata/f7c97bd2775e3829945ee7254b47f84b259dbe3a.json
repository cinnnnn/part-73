Gigantic (Ã¢â‚¬Å“AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Challenge for Crossing RecordÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) is about to race its rival, the slightly smaller S.S. Colossal across the Atlantic from New YorkÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Pier 97 to Cherbourg in two-and-a-half days. Gigantic owner T. Frothingill Ã¢â‚¬Å“T.F.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Bellows (W.C. Fields) intends to send his nearly identical younger brother S.B. (also Fields) to sail aboard the Colossal, hoping he will cause trouble and sabotage the rival ship, enabling the Gigantic and his own Bellows Line to win.\n\nHowever S.B., who is held back due to a golf game, ends up flying over the ocean to meet the Colossal en route and mistakenly lands aboard the deck of the Gigantic instead, much to the consternation of Captain Stafford (Russell Hicks). Matters are made worse for the Gigantic when S.B.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s outrageously unlucky daughter Martha (Martha Raye) is brought onboard, being rescued after surviving the shipwreck of the yacht, Hesperus V.\n\nPopular OBC radio emcee Buzz Fielding (Bob Hope), who has just been released from Ã¢â‚¬Å“alimony jailÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and is broadcasting live from the Gigantic, is trying to juggle his three ex-wives Cleo (Shirley Ross), Grace (Grace Bradley), and Joan (Lorna Gray); his lukewarm girlfriend Dorothy Wyndham (Dorothy Lamour); and his inept microphone assistant Mike (Ben Blue). Buzz does his best throughout the voyage to announce the progress of the race and introduce a series of musical acts for the pleasure of the passengers and OBCÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s radio audience.\n\nMeanwhile Dorothy is romanced by First Officer (and inventor of the GiganticÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s enormous radio power plant) Robert Hayes (Leif Erickson), just as Buzz and Joan get sentimental about their broken marriage.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Bitrate: 1295 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime: 91 mins\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 91 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7c97bd2775e3829945ee7254b47f84b259dbe3a","amp;dn":"Bob+Hope+Tribute+Collection+-+Big+Broadcast+of+1938+Xvid+1cd+%5BDD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7c97bd2775e3829945ee7254b47f84b259dbe3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,201,123,210,119,94,56,41,148,94,231,37,75,71,248,75,37,157,190,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
