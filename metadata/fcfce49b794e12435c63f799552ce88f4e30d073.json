It is using alphaOS_14.5 as its base, alphaOS being derived from Arch Linux. \n In a short description, this OS is arch based OS but with initrd from Fatdog630, and a puppy linux like init. \n\nWhat have I changed from the original alphaOS? \n \n- Initrd replaced with the use of initrd fd630 \n - UEFI idea from fd630 too \n - using stable kernel 3.13 .config is from alphaOS 14.5 \n\n \n\n I am open to every good input likes bug report, suggestions and criticisms or patch \n\n credits: \n - James Budiono \n - Kirk \n - Simargl, alphaOS original author \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcfce49b794e12435c63f799552ce88f4e30d073","amp;dn":"Puppy_Linux_AlphaT64_20-Mar-2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcfce49b794e12435c63f799552ce88f4e30d073","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,252,228,155,121,78,18,67,92,99,247,153,85,44,232,143,78,48,208,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
