No need to close RoboForm before patching; the patch will kill the processes for you.  All you need to do is run the RoboForm TaskBar Icon after patching.\n\nSee included screen shots of both RF editions with and without Sync enabled.\n\nCurrently working on Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 x64\n\nEnjoy!\n\nNOTE: To date, there is still no universal patch for roboform-x64.dll, so you will have to continue using a 32-bit browser or pay for a legitimate Roboform license to enable 64-bit browser support. (or find another patched roboform-x64.dll for this version of RF)\n\nNOTE 2: I have seen the rare comment that the patch doesn't work after version &quot;blah blah blah&quot; (it's always different).  If at first you don't succeed, try running the patch a 2nd time.\n\nVirusTotal results for the patch reveal 'generic' malware flags (6/46) since it IS a functional patcher.\nResults URL: https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/5663a7ec1fc12f19fc6a582340960bcf8d6f7435f9328d39467081bfd046badf/analysis/1367295054/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:945671f4f047b891ba3f823ec0b6e2c33841d2eb","amp;dn":"RoboForm+Pro+Desktop+and+RoboForm2Go+v7.8.8.5+%26copy%3B2013+with+pa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"945671f4f047b891ba3f823ec0b6e2c33841d2eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,86,113,244,240,71,184,145,186,63,130,62,192,182,226,195,56,65,210,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
