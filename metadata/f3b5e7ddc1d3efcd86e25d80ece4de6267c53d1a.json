Their mother Shirley Ã¢â‚¬â€œ unable to cope with her demanding daughters and unsupported by her philandering politician husband, Barry Ã¢â‚¬â€œ suffers a nervous breakdown. After Barry commits his wife to a mental hospital (telling his constituents that Ã¢â‚¬Å“sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on holidayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) he finds himself alone with 5 teenage girls he barely knows. Desperate, he impulsively picks up a hitchhiker named Shaz and installs her in his home as nanny to his daughters.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1655416/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1655416/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGenre: Comedy | Drama\niMDB Rating: 5,7/10 from 1 639 users\nDirector: P.J.
