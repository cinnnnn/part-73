Please let me explain...\n\nToday's Monday.  Because there's enough music to do so, I am assembling a bundle today.  Tomorrow is Tuesday, the day new music is typically released.  There's a good chance that some of you may be hoping for, and even anticipating a release from tomorrow.  But because I am bundling today, if you're looking to get that new album from me, you may have to wait another week or two until I have gathered enough music for yet another bundle.\n\nBecause of that, I've decided to occasionally do a little file sharing.  If you've visited, and read in my previous thread, some of you might taken advantage of a download link for KB's new &quot;100 EP&quot;, as well as the new Jason Gray &quot;Love Will Have The Final Word&quot; album.  For the rest of you, those albums are being shared here today.\n\nSo what does this mean?  Simply put, it means nothing changes.  It means I will continue to torrent music that is represented to me as Christian Music.  But from time to time, if something noteworthy comes along between bundles, be sure to check in with the current &quot;Year In Christian Music&quot; thread, as I may provide a 24 or 48 hour download in advance of these torrents.\n\nThat being said, just to get the ball rolling for anyone interested, I will share two direct downloads today.  Details are in my post below.\n\nSINGER-SONGWRITER: Bailey Regier, Florence Lang, Illijam, Kyle Lippert, Stephen Hample.  HIP-HOP/RAP: Bias Truth, EliVate, Eric C, Jonathan Baker, KB, KhingKloud, Loonah, Mark Ant, New 11, Scooda, Too Deep.  BLUES: Big Daddy Wilson.  CONTEMPORARY: Brandon Gilliam, Ellie Holcomb, Jason Gray, Michael Boggs, Various God, WoodsEdge Worship.  HARDCORE/METAL: Demon Hunter, The Overseer, The Saving.  GOSPEL: Gaither Vocal Band.
