The wife waits for him. and the story takes a turn with the death news of Ajay. The movie has excellent music and above all Noor Jehan's songs, that were live recorded at studio sets make it a miracle; a musical experience that one comes across only once in a life time\n\nDespite many shortcomings, accruing from the  incompetence  of  a number  of  film-makers,  Pakistani movies, especially those made during its golden  era  (from  1955  to  1975),  created  several landmarks.  Some  important 'first' of Pakistan cinema are listed hereunder:\n\n- Do Ansoo in Urdu was the first Pakistani  film  which  celebrated its silver jubilee in 1950.\n- Umer Marvi was the first Gujrati film which  was  produced  in  a Karachi studio, and released on September 1, 1970.\n- The first Balochi film, Hamalo Mah Gunj, was made  in  1976,  but could  not  be  released  due  to strong protest by the people of Balochistan.\n- The first English film produced in Pakistan (Karachi) was  Beyond the Last Mountain.\n- Q Zaman was the first film-maker  who  experimented  with  taking colour shots of a film song recorded for Gul Bakauli, released in 1970. Jago Hooa Swera was the first film produced and directed by A   J  Kardar  in  1953  which  won  numerous  kudos  at  several international fora.\n- The first female director of a film produced in Pakistan was  Nur Jehan  who  directed  Punjabi  Chan  Way  in  1951. Many insiders contested this claim, but her name appeared  on  the  credits  of that  film  as  its  director).  She also enacted the role of the heroine in the same movie. Feroze Nizami's compositions  for  the film  won  uproarious acclaim throughout the length and breath of Pakistan as well as in Indian Punjab.\n- Baghi (Urdu) was the first Pakistani film produced in 1956, which was released in the People's Republic of China.\n- Sassi (Urdu) was the  first  Pakistani  film  which  successfully competed  with  Indian movies. Earlier, Hichkoley and Phairey had also offered stiff competition  to  Indian  movies  exhibited  in Pakistan.\n- Arman (Urdu) celebrated its platinum jubilee.\n- Dosti (Urdu) celebrated its diamond jubilee  with  a  run  of  50 weeks.\n- The first film song which became a super-hit in Pakistan was Mein Pyar  Ka  Diya  Jalata  Hoon,  sung  by Ali Bakhsh Zahoor. Master Inayat Hussain provided melodic raiments to  that  song  for  the film Hichkoley, which was written by Saifuddin Saif.\n- All songs of film Baiqarar (Urdu) sung by  Munawwar  Sultana  and Ali  Bakhsh  Zahur,  composed  by  Master Ghulam Haider after his arrival from Bombay, won wide popularity.\n- Composer G A Chishti wrote and composed  six  songs  for  Nazir's Punjabi  film  Phairey (1950) in one day and recorded them at one go the same day. This record has not yet been broken by any other composer in Pakistan.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-1\nVideo Bitrate: 1119 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 352x288\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec:  MPEG-1 Layer 2\nAudio Bitrate: 224kb/s CBR 44100 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: Hindi\nRunTime: 2:24:49\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]    \nDuration: 2:24:49","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3513b2df0130bfa8ac3756afef17b0f7c95f3cc","amp;dn":"Dupatta+%281952%29+VCD_Indian+Cinema+-+The+Golden+Years_Classic+%5BDDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3513b2df0130bfa8ac3756afef17b0f7c95f3cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,81,59,45,240,19,11,250,138,195,117,106,254,241,123,15,124,149,243,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
