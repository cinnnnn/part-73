The name is an English translation from 'Oskorei', a European folktale. Members have adopted stage names and wear outlandish costumes and face paint when playing live.&quot;\n\nThis Torrent is for the 'Instigation EP' 2011 + The Promo Mix of &quot;Incubator&quot; used for promotion in 2013.\n\n01. Dogma I\n02. Nevermore\n03. Possession\n04. Incubator (2013PromoMix)\n\nThis EP was a promo, and the recordings here are different recordings to what is on the 'Reclaiming the Wasteland' album. It was limited to 100 in a card sleeve. Quite rare! As this EP and Incubator were used as promos, i'm happy to share for free.\n\nPlease check outfor more info.
