The nine separate albums featured the crÃƒÂ¨me de la crÃƒÂ¨me of New York's jazz community from Charlie Parker to Roy Eldridge, Ben Webster, Johnny Hodges, Oscar Peterson, Lionel Hampton and Max Roach and dozens of others. This box set simply collects all nine LPs on five remastered CDs, containing original artwork in a slipcase that fits inside a handsome metal display box. The individual volumes are of consistently very high quality and are utterly indispensable to jazz aficionados. For those who already have the discs, this is merely superfluous. For those who don't, this is a pricey buy but a hell of a way to begin a jazz education.\n\nTrack list:\nCD 1\n01 - Jam Blues\n02 - Ballad Medley\n03 - What Is This Thing Called Love\n04 - Funky Blues\nCD 2\n01 - Apple Jam\n02 - Ballad Medley\n03 - Oh, Lady Be Good!\n04 - Blues for the Count\nCD 3\n01 - Jamming for Clef\n02 - Rose Room\n03 - Stompin' at the Savoy (Part 1)\n04 - Stompin' at the Savoy (Part 2)\nCD 4\n01 - Blue Lou\n02 - Just You, Just Me\n03 - Jam Blues\n04 - Ballad Medley\nCD 5\n01 - Funky Blues\n02 - Lullaby in Rhythm\n\nEnjoy and share!
