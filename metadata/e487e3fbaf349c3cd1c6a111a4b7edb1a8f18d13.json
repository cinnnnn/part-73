Finding her the worse for wear and living out of a battered RV, they drive their mother cross-state to a rehab center on a journey that will redefine the meaning of &quot;family&quot; for all of them. With beautiful cinematography, shot on location in the breathtaking desert landscapes of New Mexico, JACKIE is a fresh and heartwarming take on the classic American road movie.
