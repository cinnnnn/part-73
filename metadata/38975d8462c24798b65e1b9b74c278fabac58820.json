The four-night New YearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s run in 1997 at the Fox Theatre not only ushered in 1998, it also gave us our first show of 1998Ã¢â‚¬Â¦and also the last show in the states before Widespread Panic took off to Australia and EuropeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦to come back for some Panic in the Streets in April. \n\nThe decision to spread the four Fox shows over five days was genius...Build up to New Years, take a night off on New YearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s day to recover from the celebration, and then gather again on the 2nd to see what happens. \n\nWell, what happened was just another incredible Widespread Panic experience.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38975d8462c24798b65e1b9b74c278fabac58820","amp;dn":"Widespread+Panic+-+1998-01-02+-+Fox+Theatre+in+Atlanta%2C+GA++SBD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38975d8462c24798b65e1b9b74c278fabac58820","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,151,93,132,98,194,71,152,182,94,27,155,116,194,120,250,186,197,136,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
