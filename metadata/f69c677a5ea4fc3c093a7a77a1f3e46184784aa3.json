After fleeing Germany to pursue a stage career in Amsterdam, he was caught and sent to Terezin\n\nThis was an artists colony where talented people were offered a refuge in the middle of Nazi Germany - or was it?\n\nNo, of course the whole thing was a sham, just another step on the way to dusty death.\n\nGerron was a fascinating character in his own right, this documentary is worth seeing just for him.\n\nAnother youtube reseed in mp4 format.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f69c677a5ea4fc3c093a7a77a1f3e46184784aa3","amp;dn":"Prisoner+of+Paradise+%282003%29+Kurt+Gerron+Terezin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f69c677a5ea4fc3c093a7a77a1f3e46184784aa3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,156,103,122,94,164,252,60,9,58,122,119,161,243,228,97,132,120,74,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
