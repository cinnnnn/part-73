Here, Lord Mountbatten narrates his life story using a wealth of historical material from the archives of the world - including much from his own personal collection. This extraordinary 12 episode series spans 70 years of triumph, conflict and glory in the life of this remarkable man who rose to worldwide recognition as both statesman and military hero, yet was tragically assassinated in 1979. It is this tremendous sweep of international events and changes that has been recaptured in ths unique series. Unique because it is not only about, but with the man concerned. The production team, including Lord Mountbatten, revisited many of the locales in which his career was formed - Malta, Burma, Ceylon, Singapore, India. Excerpts have been incuded from many of those whose lives and duties infuenced those of Lord Mountbatten, or were influenced by him. They include the Duke of Windsor, Prince Philip, six former Prime Ministers, General Eisenhower and other key figures in world history. \n\nA Television History by John Terraine\nProduced and Directed by Peter Morley\nNarration spoken by Alec Mango\nA Rediffusion Television Production\n\n\n\n1)  The King's Ships Were at Sea \nThe introductory episode of the series, dealing with the years 1900-1917.\n\nSetting the tone for the series of personal reminiscences (related by Mountbatten) against a more general history of the times (narrated by Mango), this episode charts Mountbatten's early years (from his birth in 1900 to the beginning of his naval career serving as midshipman under Beatty on HMS Queen Elizabeth) and his family's position in relation to the Great War and its origins. The Dreadnoughts, Gallipoli, the Battle of Jutland, U-boats, conscription, form the background to the resignation of Mountbatten's father, Prince Louis of Battenburg, as First Sea Lord, and the Battenburgs' change of name (to Mountbatten) as the result of anti-German feeling, at which point &quot;the Mountbatten story can be said to begin.&quot;\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img507.imageshack.us/img507/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img507.imageshack.us/img507/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img689.imageshack.us/img689/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img689.imageshack.us/img689/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img221.imageshack.us/img221/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img221.imageshack.us/img221/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img197.imageshack.us/img197/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img197.imageshack.us/img197/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img713.imageshack.us/img713/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img713.imageshack.us/img713/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img9.imageshack.us/img9/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img9.imageshack.us/img9/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img593.imageshack.us/img593/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img593.imageshack.us/img593/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img109.imageshack.us/img109/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img109.imageshack.us/img109/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/8505/thelifeandtimesoflordmoo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/8505/thelifeandtimesoflordmoo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1987 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x528\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 224kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 49:25.592\nNumber Of Parts: 12\nPart Size: 785 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f3465dfd4fb97c46ea0c6cd73fb0048bfaa46c0","amp;dn":"Thames+Television+The+Life+and+Times+of+Lord+Mountbatten+01of12+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f3465dfd4fb97c46ea0c6cd73fb0048bfaa46c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,52,101,223,212,251,151,196,110,160,198,205,115,251,0,72,191,170,70,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
