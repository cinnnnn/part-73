Set in Baltimore in 1954 at the birth of rock &amp; roll, the film features Johnny Depp as Wade Cry-Baby Walker. Depp is pure charisma as a juvenile delinquent with a permanent tear slithering down his cheek, a reminder of his state-executed parents. In the depths of his despair appears goody-goody girl Allison (Amy Locane), who has a sexual crush on Cry-Baby. But Allison's Pat Boone-like boyfriend, Baldwin (Stephen E. Miller), the leader of the squares, is dead set against Cry-Baby and the rest of the juvenile delinquents and leads a revolt against them. In the resultant riot, the juvenile delinquents are blamed for the chaos, and Cry-Baby finds himself dispatched to reform school.~ Paul Brenner, All Movie Guide","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0fccf49be0ec6fe0ef79b47176a272fd076b241","amp;dn":"Cry+Baby","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0fccf49be0ec6fe0ef79b47176a272fd076b241","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,252,207,73,190,14,198,254,14,247,155,71,23,106,39,47,208,118,178,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
