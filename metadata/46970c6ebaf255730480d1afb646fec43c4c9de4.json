On today's show, Alex welcomes author and Senior Editor of the influential The New American, William F. Jasper, to discuss the escalating tensions in eastern Ukraine, the continued efforts by the west to intervene in Syria, and why the government's actions against the Bundy ranch are merely &quot;an ominous portent of more to come.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
