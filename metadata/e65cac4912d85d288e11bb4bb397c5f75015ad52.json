Utilizing a small big band comprised of 12 pieces, Ferguson is in consistently fiery form during a session recorded live at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco. &quot;Bebop Buffet&quot; (which has quotes from many bop classics) is a high point, and these versions of &quot;Lush Life&quot; and &quot;On the Sunny Side of the Street&quot; (along with four group originals) are quite enjoyable; baritonist Denis DiBlasio's arrangements are a major asset. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Fireshaker\n02 - Coconut Champagne\n03 - Lush Life\n04 - South 21St Shuffle\n05 - Bebop Buffet\n06 - On The Sunny Side Of The Street\n07 - Ganesha\n\nSplit with Medieval. Sorry.\nEnjoy and share!
