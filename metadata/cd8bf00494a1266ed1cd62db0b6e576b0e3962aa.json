The city and camp were the scenes of fierce fighting, which ended with Jenin flattened, and scores of Palestinians dead. Palestinians, as well as numerous human rights groups accused Israel of committing war-crimes in the attack. The United Nations appointed a commission of inquiry, but Israel refused to let it's members visit the scene.\n\nBanned in Israel, &quot;Jenin Jenin&quot; is dedicated to Iyad Samoudi, the producer of the film, who returned home to Yamun after the shooting of the film was completed. On June 23, as Israeli forces besieged Yamun, Samoudi was shot and killed as he was leaving a military-closed area with three friends.\n\nSpecial DVD Features Include:\n\nSlideshow with Eyewitness Account\nMap of Jenin\nScene Selections\nFilmmaker Biographies\n\nCover: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/cxi9mn2k7/full/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/cxi9mn2k7/full/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nScreens: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/ksnj0nosv&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/ksnj0nosv&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/wcqvvm4an&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/wcqvvm4an&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/ur4yai869&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/ur4yai869&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease seed the DVD documentaries that you like, thank you very much! &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/cockymountainoyster&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/cockymountainoyster&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd8bf00494a1266ed1cd62db0b6e576b0e3962aa","amp;dn":"Jenin+Jenin+%28DVD5%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd8bf00494a1266ed1cd62db0b6e576b0e3962aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,139,240,4,148,161,38,110,209,205,98,219,11,110,87,107,14,57,98,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
