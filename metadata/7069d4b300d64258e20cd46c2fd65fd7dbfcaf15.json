Chalk Dust contained DEG teases from Mike. The ending of Chalk Dust was performed at near double-time. Trey omitted a verse in Wilson. Afterwards, he announced that it was the Ã¢â‚¬Å“shortest version everÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and dedicated it to Phish archivist Kevin Shapiro. Trey then humorously announced that the band would next play the Ã¢â‚¬Å“longest Bittersweet MotelÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (traditionally one of the shortest songs in the Phish canon). The crowd responded with a passionate Ã¢â‚¬Å“FluffheadÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ chant, but Trey responded: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mike says noÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (prompting laughs from the other band members). Appropriately, Trey launched into MikeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Song but Mike had the last laugh: during the MikeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Song intro, Mike sang his Ã¢â‚¬Å“HendgeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ lyric that had been omitted from Wilson. Weekapaug included a Seven Below tease. YEM contained the event-appropriate lyrical change Ã¢â‚¬Å“Boy, Man, God, IT,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a Frankenstein tease from Mike, and a vocal quote of Daniel Saw the Stone. The band vamped on the theme to Chariots of Fire (a Phish debut) while Trey introduced the top finishers in the Runaway Jim 5K race. During Antelope, Trey thanked the staff, road crew, caterers (Ã¢â‚¬Å“part of the reason weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re playing so well is because we have the best food this tour that weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever hadÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), and fans. He concluded by encouraging everyone to drive safely and noted tongue-in-cheek that next yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“IT 2Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ would have a traffic-free entrance. Antelope also included Under Pressure and ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ice teases.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7069d4b300d64258e20cd46c2fd65fd7dbfcaf15","amp;dn":"Phish+-+2003-08-03+-+IT%2C+Loring+Air+Force+Base+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7069d4b300d64258e20cd46c2fd65fd7dbfcaf15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,105,212,179,0,214,66,88,226,12,212,108,47,214,95,215,219,252,175,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
