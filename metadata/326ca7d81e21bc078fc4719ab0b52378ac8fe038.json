This JavaScript-based language allows you to access Google Apps data, automate tasks, and build your own applications. Join Scott Simpson as he introduces the Google Apps Script environment; defines the common script types, permissions, and classes; and dives into scripting services. Learn to access and edit data from documents and spreadsheets, use cloud storage, set up events and triggers, and create user interfaces like dialogs. Plus, learn to publish and share your script as a web app. At the end of the course, Scott challenges you to pull all the lessons you've learned together and build an app based on some simple parameters.\n\n\nPlease Seed and enjoy.\nRegards,\nMasum.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.sx/user/masum2444/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.sx/user/masum2444/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:326ca7d81e21bc078fc4719ab0b52378ac8fe038","amp;dn":"Lynda-Up+%26amp%3B+Running+with+Google+Apps+Script+2014%5Bmasum2444%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"326ca7d81e21bc078fc4719ab0b52378ac8fe038","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,108,167,216,30,33,188,7,143,196,113,154,176,181,35,120,172,143,224,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
