Murrow award winning journalist. After 15 years as a broadcast journalist, working for NBC and FOX affiliate TV stations, Ben set out to create the Truth in Media Project. The crowd sourced project has had over 1,000,000 views on Benswann.com, Youtube and Roku. The Truth in Media Project is now headed to Hulu and Amazon Prime. In both 2014 and 2013, Ben was the popular vote winner of the Shorty Award for excellence in social and new media as a journalist. His website Benswann.com has over 1.5 million page views a month.\n\nBefore setting out on his own, Ben was the prime time anchor at Fox affiliate WXIX where he was the producer/writer/anchor of a segment called &quot;Reality Check&quot;. His Reality Check series was internationally viewed, garnering more than 10 million views on YouTube. It was while covering the 2012 Republican Presidential primary that I began to confront the problems in the American electoral process, the stranglehold of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s two party system and the suppression of votersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ choices by mainstream media.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
