Read the release notes below for details.\n\nNote that in Unity 4.1.1 an issue was causing Asset Store packages to fail. In 4.1.2, UnityEngine.dll and UnityEditor.dll are no longer signed/strong-named, and compiled assemblies can now reference the UnityEditor and UnityEngine namespaces again.\n\nThe Unity 4.1.1 release notes have been combined with the Unity 4.1.2\n\n\nPlease note that there is no backwards compatibility from Unity 4.0; projects made in 4.0 will not open in 3.x. However, Unity 4.0 will import and convert 3.x projects. We advise you to back up your project before converting and check the console log for any errors or warnings after importing.\n\n\nCrack Included\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5b987c4e9c79a9122aabae53427ce54e59babc5","amp;dn":"Unity+3D+Pro+4.1.2f1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5b987c4e9c79a9122aabae53427ce54e59babc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,185,135,196,233,199,154,145,34,170,186,229,52,39,206,84,229,155,171,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
