Of the 294 men aboard the vessel, 34 were killed and 172 were wounded.\n\nFor years the survivors kept silent about what happened, under threat by military authorities of severe punishment if they revealed the truth. Now, in this powerful film documentary, USS Liberty survivors speak with moving candor about what really happened.\n\n&quot;The Loss of Liberty&quot; includes interviews with high-ranking Israeli military officers. High-ranking American military and civilian officials, including Dean Rusk, former U.S. Secretary of State, and Admiral Thomas Moorer, former Chairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff, provide authoritative analysis.\n\n&quot;I have never believed that the attack on the USS Liberty was a case of mistaken identity,&quot; Admiral Moorer has said. &quot;What is so chilling and cold-blooded, of course, is that they [the Israelis] could kill as many Americans as they did in confidence that Washington would cooperate in quelling any public outcry. I have to conclude that it was Israel's intent to sink the Liberty and leave as few survivors as possible.&quot;\n\nReminds me of 9/11.\n\n&quot;Israel's premeditated, sneak attack, on the USS Liberty was a direct attack on America,&quot; says Phillip Tourney, a crewman wounded in the attack. Awarded the Bronze Star for his heroism under fire, he is president of the USS Liberty Veterans Association. &quot;The disgraceful refusal of unpatriotic American governmental officials of dubious allegiance to defend America and come to the aid of brave Americans under attack can only be characterized as treasonous,&quot; he says.\n\n&quot;The Loss of Liberty&quot; tells the shocking, long-suppressed truth about the treacherous assault, and tears to shreds the shameful official story that the attack was a case of mistaken identity.\n\nThe attack on the USS Liberty was a deliberate attempt to start World War 3, for the expansion of Ha'aretz Yisroel, the theft of the region's oil resources, and for the building of a temple/synagogue smack on top of the Dome of the Rock, kicked off by the nuclear bombing of Cairo, in 'revenge' for the USS Liberty's sinking, and starting with an American invasion of Egypt, up through the Sinai, all the way to Babylon and back. You don't have to believe me, but it is the truth.\n\n&quot;The Kennedys will never embarrass me againÃ¢â‚¬â€that's no threatÃ¢â‚¬â€that's a promise.&quot;\n~ Lyndon Johnson, 36th president of the USA, Mason, unelected, traitor.\n\nRuntime: 52m\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://gtr5.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://gtr5.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nScreens: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/vvgbiad65&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/vvgbiad65&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/51ktajne5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/51ktajne5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/w4ihlyfcd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/w4ihlyfcd&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/kyjl79fsd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/kyjl79fsd&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/a4255bwod&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/a4255bwod&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/y1f7qj60d&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/y1f7qj60d&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/x1kbh31gt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/x1kbh31gt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/e7yik338t&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/e7yik338t&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/7djmgnl7x&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/7djmgnl7x&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/9om9ykld9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/9om9ykld9&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/ye20iyywd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/ye20iyywd&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/fx30eetkd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/fx30eetkd&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/j08bvixwt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/j08bvixwt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/dz0xu5qgd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/dz0xu5qgd&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/kdzyqtx65&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/kdzyqtx65&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/tbkoo6pm5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/tbkoo6pm5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/haz8ngi7h&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/haz8ngi7h&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/nif81d3cd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/nif81d3cd&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/lf4stp3jh&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/lf4stp3jh&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe DVD *is* being seeded, despite what the counter says.\n\nTo all good people who seed the DVDs they like, thank you very much! \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/cockymountainoyster&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/cockymountainoyster&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adefad9a62a17978b03d1759963f9698814c5a83","amp;dn":"The+Loss+Of+Liberty%3A+The+USS+Liberty+%28DVD5%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adefad9a62a17978b03d1759963f9698814c5a83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,239,173,154,98,161,121,120,176,61,23,89,150,63,150,152,129,76,90,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
