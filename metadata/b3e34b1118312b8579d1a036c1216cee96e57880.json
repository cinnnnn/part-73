Whether you're a fan of heavy-metal, \npunk-rock or pop-music - the chords, the storytelling, \nthe heart-ache and laughter. . . . are all in some way\nrooted right back to the days of traditional\nCountry-Western, Folk-Music and The Blues!\n \nEven the King of Rock N' Roll Elvis Presley loved country!\nThe early days of rock were very much influenced by singers and \nsongwriters like: Hank Williams, George Jones and Johnny Cash.\n\nLong before rebels like The Rolling Stones were being arrested,\ncountry singers were drinking whiskey, having sex with young women\nand going to jail for breaking the law!\n\nSongwriters have been getting pissed off and protesting against\nthe government since before the days of Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger.\nIn the 1960's Bob Dylan wrote folk-songs that criticized society,\nquestioned traditional values and expressed anger towards\nthe unjust laws and greedy politicians.\n\nProtest Folk has inspired many great artists, both young and old - \nfrom Bob Dylan and John Lennon to Nirvana and Jack Johnson.\nThere are just so many singers and songwriters who owe a debt of\ngratitude to the legends of Country-Western, Folk-Music and The Blues!\n\n**********************************************************************\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3e34b1118312b8579d1a036c1216cee96e57880","amp;dn":"Bruce+Springsteen+%2B+Johnny+Cash+%28+Classic+Roots+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3e34b1118312b8579d1a036c1216cee96e57880","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,227,75,17,24,49,43,133,121,209,160,54,193,33,108,238,150,229,120,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
