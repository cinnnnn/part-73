Instead, 28,000 music lovers enjoured a six-hour feast of reggae, featuring both Jamaican acts and homegrown talent at Selhurst Park. Reggae Sunsplash came to town - and brought some of the hottest weather this summer with it. There were rastas in shorts, toddlers with dreadlocks, bare-chested punks and skimpily-clad females providing a vivid splash of colour. The park itself was jammed with bodies - sitting, reclining or dancing to the sounds coming from the massive stage.\n\nPolice deliberately kept a low profile, turning a blind eye to the widespread use of &quot;sensimilia&quot; (marijuana) which is part of the Rastafarian faith. But the high quality of the performances needed nostimulants.\n\nThe line-up included the Skatalites, Aswad, Black Uhuru, Sly &amp; Robbie, Musical Youth, Dennis Brown, Leroy Sibbles and King Sunny Ade, plus DJs David Rodigan and Barry G.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b49feb77f432ba8e78b44f547a0117b88a5358cd","amp;dn":"Aswad+-+1984-07-07+-+Selhurst+Park%2C+London%2C+England","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b49feb77f432ba8e78b44f547a0117b88a5358cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,159,235,119,244,50,186,142,120,180,79,84,122,1,23,184,138,83,88,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
