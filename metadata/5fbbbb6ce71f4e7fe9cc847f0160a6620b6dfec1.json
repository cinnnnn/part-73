Working toward a masterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s degree in wildlife biology while helping take care of her sick father, she has no time for celebrity gossip, designer clothes, or lazy vacations. So when a duchess from the small country of Lilaria invites her to dinner, Samantha assumes itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s to discuss a donation for the program. The truth will change the course of her life in ways she never dreamed.\n\nAlex DÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Lynsal is trying to keep his name clean. As crown prince of Lilaria, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s had his share of scandalous headlines, but the latest pictures have sent him packing to America and forced him to swear off womenÃ¢â‚¬â€especially women in the public eye. That is, until he meets Samantha Rousseau. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stubborn, feisty, and incredibly sexy. Not to mention heiress to an estate in his country, which makes her everyoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s front-page news.\n\nWhile Sam tries to navigate the new world of politics and wealth, she will also have to dodge her growing feelings for Alex. Giving in to them means more than just falling in love; it would mean accepting the weight of an entire country on her shoulders.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fbbbb6ce71f4e7fe9cc847f0160a6620b6dfec1","amp;dn":"Suddenly+Royal+By+Nichole+Chase+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fbbbb6ce71f4e7fe9cc847f0160a6620b6dfec1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,187,187,108,231,31,78,127,233,204,132,127,1,96,166,98,11,109,254,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
