He hasn't aged. Much of Earth is laid in ruins, Nerv has been dismantled, and people who he once protected have turned against him. Befriending the enigmatic Nagisa Kowaru, Shinji continues the fight against the angels and realizes the fighting is far from over, even when it could be against his former allies.
