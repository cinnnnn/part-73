His indifference to police procedure often leads to conflict with Captain Thomas Gregson (Aidan Quinn), although the two still remain mutually respectful of one another. He is accompanied by Watson who initially acts as his sober companion. She is a former surgeon and was hired by Sherlock's father to help him in his rehabilitation. They eventually begin to work together on his cases, and she becomes Holmes' apprentice. The series also features Holmes' ongoing conflict with his nemesis Jamie Moriarty, a.k.a. Irene Adler (Natalie Dormer). Other supporting roles include Jon Michael Hill as Detective Marcus Bell and Rhys Ifans as Mycroft Holmes, who wishes for Sherlock to return to England.\n\nE01 - Pilot\nE02 - While You Were Sleeping\nE03 - Child Predator\nE04 - The Rat Race\nE05 - Lesser Evils\nE06 - Flight Risk\nE07 - One Way to Get Off\nE08 - The Long Fuse\nE09 - You Do It to Yourself\nE10 - The Leviathan\nE11 - Dirty Laundry\nE12 - M\nE13 - The Red Team\nE14 - The Deductionist\nE15 - A Giant Gun, Filled with Drugs\nE16 - Details\nE17 - Possibility Two\nE18 - DÃƒÂ©jÃƒÂ  Vu All Over Again\nE19 - Snow Angels\nE20 - Dead Man's Switch\nE21 - A Landmark Story\nE22 - Risk Management\nE23 - The Woman\nE24 - Heroine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4853bf008984c29835c0256a7b0eb05e3bb8ff44","amp;dn":"Elementary+Season+1+720p+Legendado+PTbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4853bf008984c29835c0256a7b0eb05e3bb8ff44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,83,191,0,137,132,194,152,53,192,37,106,123,14,176,94,59,184,255,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
