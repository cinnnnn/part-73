Would've been better without the introduction on every track, in my opinion, but I guess I wasn't there. Still a highly enjoyable listening.\n\nTrack list:\nPart 1\n01 - Mother\n02 - El Dopa\n03 - Blue Birdland\n04 - Maria\n05 - Nice And Juicy\n06 - 'Round About Midnight\n07 - The Foxhunt\nPart 2\n01 - Macarthur Park\n02 - Blue Birdland\n03 - Blue Birdland (2)\n04 - Take The 'A' Train\n05 - All Right, Allright\n06 - Country Road\n07 - Hey Jude\n\nSplit with Medieval. Sorry.\nEnjoy and share!
