(Some anti-virus may detect the keygen as a false positive, this is because many keygens use exe packers that get detected, if you still dont trust this just use the keys above, I generated them using the keygen and the keygen was made by Lz0 so props to them!)\n\n- Afterwards you may want to run the game updater for the main menu, you should be able to update to the latest versions or even the very latest betas right from there, it will download all updates sequencially then close game and launch the auto-updated witch then unpacks and installs the update data.\nnote: If you cant get updater to work, you may need to allow the game through your firewall software or you can goto http://www.arcengames.com/dl/AIWarBetaUpdates2.xml and download each update manually, you MUST download each and every update number from your current version so if you see versiobn 6.00 at the top left of the games main menu you should download B6003, B6007, B6010 then B6024 and extract them to the game install folder one by one in proper order overwritting/updating data. So the updates must be installed sequentially, in proper order to work. As of writting latest version is 6000 and latest beta is 6024.\n\n- If running Windows 8 you might want to right click on the AIWar.exe, goto properties and under the compatability tab check the box &quot;Run this program as an Administrator&quot; this will sometimes fix issus where the game asks for serials each time your start. But some may not need to do this. I did and I'm on Windows 8 Pro X64\n\n- After fully installed, activated and updated you should be good to go! Have fun!

So, to enable The Zenith Remnant, it would be &quot;cmd:activate expansion 1&quot; without quotes.  This includes enabling the expansion ship classes, as well as enabling other new capturables and AI weapons to be found in the galaxy, although the population of those capturables is likely to be different from what it would have been if the expansion had been turned on from the start of the campaign given the same seed and other settings. There is no way to disable the expansion for an existing game, however, so be sure not to save over your existing file if you want to go back to the non-expansion version of the game.\n                      \n \n                     ****     TRY  BEFORE  YOU  BUY     ****\nIF YOU LIKE THIS GAME, BUY IT!
