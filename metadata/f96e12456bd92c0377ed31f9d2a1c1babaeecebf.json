The organisation is led by Fred Phelps and located in Topeka, Kansas. Westboro Baptist Church members believe that the United States government is immoral due to its tolerance of homosexuality; in addition, they protest at funerals of U.S. military killed in action with signs that display text such as &quot;God Hates Fags&quot; and &quot;Thank God for Dead Soldiers&quot;. With a BBC film crew, Theroux traveled to Kansas to spend time with members of the church and interview its leadership. In the documentary, church members are shown protesting at funerals of U.S. soldiers.
