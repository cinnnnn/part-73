Bordeleau \n# ISBN-10: 1461409284 \n# ISBN-13: 978-1461409281 \n# 220 pages\n# Springer; 2014 edition\n\n\nMany national flags display astronomical features-Sun, Moon, stars-but are they really based on existing astronomical objects? The United States flag sports 50 stars, one for each state, however none of them are linked to real stars. Further, the lunar crescent is often shaped like the Sun being eclipsed by the Moon. At times, stars are seen right next to the crescent, where the darkened disc of the moon should be! This book will present true astronomical objects and patterns highlighted on national flags and link informative capsules about these objects to the political reasons why they were chosen to adorn such an important symbol. \n\n\n- Explains stars and constellations found on national flags from numerous countries throughout the world \n\n- Presents a complete coverage of symbols in the sky displayed on national banners -- from lunar crescents to the southern cross \n\n- Offers an original approach to basic astronomy while also teaching the history of why these astronomical symbols were used \n\n\n\nAbout the Author\n================\nAndrÃƒÂ© G. Bordeleau has been an amateur astronomer since 1982. He got involved with the Physics and Astronomy club at the University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada while he was completing a Master's degree in Political Science.  He spent the better part of the 1980's with the club, selecting topics for meetings, presenting talks as well as offering guided tours of the University's observatory.  He was named a Lifetime Honorary Member of the club in 1987.  He gave guided tours of the observatory and astronomy talks to outside groups and schools on behalf of the University of Guelph's Outreach Program from 1987 until 1990.\n\nHe has been involved in the fight for eradicating light pollution since 1987.  He has written several articles on popular astronomy topics in both English and French, many of them specifically on light pollution. Bordeleau has translated 5 astronomy books from English to French. He has been a planetarium lecturer for nearly 20 years. From 1978 to 1990, he was a member of the Canadian National Moving Target Rifle Team and competed in the 1984 and 1988 Olympic Trials. He also won the Ontario Championships in 1984. In 1990, he travelled to Australia and New Zealand in order to admire the southern sky.  He has fallen in love with it and wishes for another opportunity to return, this time with a telescope, to resume his observations.\n\n-_-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:508e266ab631d906e5ed3de141f28a271e67b510","amp;dn":"Flags+of+the+Night+Sky%3A+When+Astronomy+Meets+National+Pride","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"508e266ab631d906e5ed3de141f28a271e67b510","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,142,38,106,182,49,217,6,229,237,61,225,65,242,138,39,30,103,181,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
