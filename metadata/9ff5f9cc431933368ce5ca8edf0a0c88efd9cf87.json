The film is based on a story by Robert Considine and stars Brian Donlevy, Claire Trevor, Forrest Tucker, Vera Ralston and Luther Adler.\n\nWWII veteran and ex-gangster, Joe Gray (John Russell) is subpoenaed to testify against his uncle and current mob boss, Nick Mancini (Luther Adler). Nick must restrain Charley Pignatalli (Forrest Tucker), his violent second-in-command, from killing Joe before he his court appearance. Torn from the headlines and shot in a semi-documentary style, Hoodlum Empire was inspired by the Kefauver investigations of 1950 and 1951. This classic film noir was directed by Joseph Kane (King of the Pecos) and was beautifully shot by Reggie Lanning (Sands of Iwo Jima). The all-star cast includes Claire Trevor, Brian Donlevy, Vera Ralston and Gene Lockhart.\n\nThe Kefauver Committee's ongoing investigation of organized crime spawned several &quot;Torn from Today's Headlines!&quot; films in the early 1950s. Republic's Hoodlum Empire concerns the efforts by gangster Joe Gray (John Russell) to get out of the rackets after WW II. Part of Gray's &quot;reclamation&quot; is to testify at a public hearing, prompting a series of flashbacks. Part of the fun is to guess who all the &quot;fictional&quot; criminals are really supposed to be: Luther Adler's character may be called &quot;Nicky Mancini,&quot; for example, but for all intents and purposes Adler is playing Frank &quot;Fifth Amendment&quot; Costello. Other famous underworld personages are impersonated by Claire Trevor, Forrest Tucker and Roy Barcroft, while the steadfast Estes Kefauver counterpart is portrayed by Brian Donlevy.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 3.51gb\nDuration.... 01:38:06\nCodec.... divx\nFrame Width..... 988\nFrame Height.... 720\nData Rate.... 5137kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23 F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 128kbps....
