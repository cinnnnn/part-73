Each are armed with weapons to reflect their gameplay style, with Kirk armed with a phaser equipped with a stun setting, while Spock's weapon is quieter and freezes enemies instead. As the player progresses through the game, they gain experience allowing them to unlock additional settings on the weapons.[4] The Gorn are set to be the enemies of the game, attacking the New Vulcan colony.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfa69e0c0f7232e4886cbe9dd11a61262ffdfc3f","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+The+Game+FLT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfa69e0c0f7232e4886cbe9dd11a61262ffdfc3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,166,158,12,15,114,50,228,136,108,190,157,209,26,97,38,47,253,252,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
