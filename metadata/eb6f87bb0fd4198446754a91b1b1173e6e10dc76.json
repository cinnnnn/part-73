Immaculate folk-rock was still present in their superb arrangements of the traditional songs &quot;Wild Mountain Thyme&quot; and &quot;John Riley.&quot; For the originals, they devised some of the first and best psychedelic rock, often drawing from the influence of Indian raga in the guitar arrangements. &quot;Eight Miles High,&quot; with its astral lyrics, pumping bassline, and fractured guitar solo, was a Top 20 hit, and one of the greatest singles of the '60s. The minor hit title track and the country-rock-tinged &quot;Mr. Spaceman&quot; are among their best songs; &quot;I See You&quot; has great 12-string psychedelic guitar solos; and &quot;I Come and Stand at Every Door&quot; is an unusual and moving update of a traditional rock tune, with new lyrics pleading for peace in the nuclear age. At the same time, the R&amp;B instrumental &quot;Captain Soul&quot; was a throwaway, &quot;Hey Joe&quot; not nearly as good as the versions by the Leaves or Jimi Hendrix, and &quot;What's Happening?!?!&quot; the earliest example of David Crosby's disagreeably vapid hippie ethos. These weak spots keep Fifth Dimension from attaining truly classic status. [The CD reissue has six notable bonus tracks, including the single version of the early psychedelic cut &quot;Why&quot; (the B-side to &quot;Eight Miles High&quot;), a significantly different alternate take of &quot;Eight Miles High,&quot; &quot;I Know My Rider&quot; (with some fine Roger McGuinn 12-string workouts), and a much jazzier, faster instrumental version of &quot;John Riley.&quot;] \n\nRelease Date\n July 18, 1966 \n\n\nGenre\nPop/Rock\n\nStyles:\nFolk-Rock\nAM Pop\nPsychedelic/Garage\nContemporary Pop/Rock\n\n\nRecording Date\n\nDecember 22, 1965 - July 28, 1966\nSubmit Corrections \n\nAlbum Moods\n\nSpacey  Trippy  Joyous  Amiable/Good-Natured  Autumnal  Dreamy  Earnest  Eerie  Literate  Soothing  Warm  Atmospheric  Bittersweet  Complex  Freewheeling  Intimate  Reflective  Smooth  Sophisticated  Street-Smart  Summery  Whimsical  \n\n\nThemes\n\nAutumn  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb6f87bb0fd4198446754a91b1b1173e6e10dc76","amp;dn":"1966+Byrds%2C+The+++%26lrm%3B%26ndash%3B+Fifth+Dimension+24bit-192khz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb6f87bb0fd4198446754a91b1b1173e6e10dc76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,111,135,187,15,212,25,132,70,117,74,145,177,177,23,62,110,16,220,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
