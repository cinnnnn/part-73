Alex looks at the likely prospect of a coming repeat of the federal assault in Nevada, this time with possibly deadly consequences. \n\nRenowned journalist, author and speaker Nomi Prins returns to the show today. Prins, a former managing director at Goldman Sachs who also worked at Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and Chase Manhattan Bank, is a member of the Federal Reserve Reform Advisory Council. Nomi's latest book is All the Presidents' Bankers: The Hidden Alliances that Drive American Power, an incisive look a century of tight, personal relationships and interdependence between America's past 19 presidents and key bankers.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
