In short order, Bob cleared up John's doubts and questions and pointed out to him the fact of our real nature: self-shining, ever-present awareness. Bob Adamson has encouraged John to share this understanding of 'who we really are.' The articles contained in this book (extended by another 30 articles in this edition) cover some of John's experiences with meeting 'Sailor' Bob Adamson and various aspects of the understanding which subsequently unfolded. Interspersed with these are chapters of email correspondence with enquirers who have been drawn to this radical and direct approach to self-realisation.\n\n\nAdvaita - John Wheeler - Shining in Plain View  PDF\n\n\nJohn Wheeler attracts a growing audience of seekers who are moving beyond traditional spiritual disciplines towards direct understanding. This book contains further dialogues and correspondence in the style of John's first book 'Awakening to the Natural State' (also published by Non-Duality Press). The emphasis is on pure non-duality (or Advaita), which points directly to the true nature of the one who is seeking. This approach reveals what is real and true about who we are and clearly exposes the false ideas and beliefs that generate doubts, problems and suffering. The result, as shown in the dialogues in this book, is that those who are willing to explore these pointers come to a direct experience of freedom and the end of seeking and suffering.\n\n\nAdvaita - John Wheeler - Right Here, Right Now: Seeing Your True Nature as Present Awareness  PDF\n\n\nThe third in the series of books of correspondence with students of the direct path by John Wheeler.\n\n\nAdvaita - John Wheeler Ã¢â‚¬â€œ You were never born  PDF\n\n\nJohn's fourth book, You Were Never Born, addresses the perennial and compelling question of our true identity. With his usual clarity and focus he answers questions from seekers in over seventy concise chapters of dialogues and in a departure from the format of his previous published collections, John has written an introductory set of prose pieces as well as a summary of 'pointers' toward the end of the text. Also included as an addendum is an extended one-to-one interview with John. A clear and beautiful guide to any aspirant of self-knowledge.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bf340a2710f8ea19c4026dd0c7131d8003ebc62","amp;dn":"Advaita+-+John+Wheeler+-+eBook+collection+RAR.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bf340a2710f8ea19c4026dd0c7131d8003ebc62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,243,64,162,113,15,142,161,156,64,38,221,12,113,49,216,0,62,188,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
