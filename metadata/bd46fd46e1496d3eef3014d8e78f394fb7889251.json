Carrion Doves\n\n\nLike a Tom Waits prodigy, Eric Bachmann employs his hopeful rasp on Red Devil Dawn creating a sweet mix of Americana, heartland melancholy and an essentially optimistic outlook. Red Devil Dawn is a welcome masterpiece of emotional subtleties Ã¢â‚¬â€ the great record that Crooked Fingers missed the mark on with 2001's drunken, bluesy and somewhat disappointing Bring On the Snakes. &quot;Big Darkness&quot; jangles along, looking for &quot;a hero coming soon.&quot; &quot;You Can Never Leave&quot; moans like something off of Heartattack and Vine or Springsteen's absolutely perfect Nebraska. And speaking of Nebraska, the hauntingly spare &quot;Bad Man Coming&quot; could have easily fit between &quot;Johnny 99&quot; and &quot;Highway Patrolman&quot; on that record Ã¢â‚¬â€ had this song come out in 1981, a 32 year old Springsteen may have covered it as readily as Waits' &quot;Jersey Girl&quot;.&quot; The best track on Red Devil Dawn has to be &quot;You Through a Spark,&quot; an exhilarating and joyful swirl of horns, guitar and raw feelings, and something closest to Waits' Rain Dogs on a manic binge. In the end, Red Devil Dawn is simply a beautiful album, and the first truly great release of 2003.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd46fd46e1496d3eef3014d8e78f394fb7889251","amp;dn":"Crooked+Fingers+-+Red+Devil+Dawn+%5B2003%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd46fd46e1496d3eef3014d8e78f394fb7889251","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,70,253,70,225,73,109,62,239,48,20,216,231,143,57,79,183,136,146,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
