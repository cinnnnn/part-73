Human trafficking paid for by US taxpayers. \n\nToday there are nearly 40,000 foreign contract workers on bases in the US militaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Central Command.\n\nHailing primarily from India and Nepal, these labourers serve American troops in facilities in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere - doing jobs including cooking, housekeeping and driving.\n\nThe US military subcontracts these manual jobs to private companies, which in turn subcontract hiring to Gulf-based contractors and local recruiters.\n\nThe promise of high salaries makes these so-called 'third country nationals' believe heading to a war zone is worth the risk.\n\nTo get the jobs, many dip into their savings and take out loans to pay thousands of dollars in local agents fees. But in Afghanistan, they find wages far lower than anticipated. Locked into an indentured workforce, they nevertheless remain to earn enough funds to repay their loans.\n\nSo, has the US military come to rely on an indentured workforce?\n\nIn this investigation, Fault Lines finds that these laborers regularly end up deceived and indebted, victims of local recruiters who charge thousands of dollars for a chance to be placed in one of these jobs, and labor traffickers who profit from military contracts.\n\nWe retrace the journey these workers often make Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from villages in India to labour camps in Dubai Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to examine how the US staffs its bases during wartime. And we travel to the Persian Gulf and the US to find out who should be held accountable.\n\nShunster-ex dailymotion","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ee50015b5362d79ba790b978d6d0d4c34360ae9","amp;dn":"America%27s+War+Workers+++AJE+Fault+Lines++2014+03","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ee50015b5362d79ba790b978d6d0d4c34360ae9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,229,0,21,181,54,45,121,186,121,11,151,141,109,13,76,52,54,10,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
