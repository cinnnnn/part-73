The only link between the families is that they both have sons who have been on the missing persons list for approximately a year. Graham concludes these &quot;Lost Boys&quot; are killing their old families to bond more closely to their new family. Graham continues his sessions with Dr. Lecter and confides that even if he finds the boys he will never be able to give them back what was taken from them; their families. Lecter's escalating interest in Abigail Hobbs leads him to check her out of the hospital, against Dr. Alana Bloom's (Caroline Dhavernas) wishes, and take her into his care. He gives her some tea made from psilocybin mushrooms to help with her traumatic dreams. Bloom helps Graham realize that the &quot;Lost Boys&quot; are under the influence of a powerful mother figure (Molly Shannon) and uses footage from a convenience store security camera to track them to North Carolina in time to stop another young boy from murdering his family.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8bd4e1ea63e09f1c5e422b97f4beaa363092b51","amp;dn":"Hannibal+S01E04+XviD+%5BJKS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8bd4e1ea63e09f1c5e422b97f4beaa363092b51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,189,78,30,166,62,9,241,197,228,34,185,127,75,234,163,99,9,43,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
