I was supposed to move on, get a life... but I'm stuck and lost. Things with my father are not good. There are demons in our closet, big ones. Ones I want to kill him for, I'm seeing a shrink, I'm trying to get better... but my life feels out of control, like I'm a raft adrift on the sea. I don't know where to look, how to get anchored again, and then I meet Zoe Stone. Something about her draws me out of my rut, makes me laugh for real, smile, and for the first time in years I want to be more. But what will she think when she discovers who I really am?\n\n...all we have...\n\nWhen Alexander Donovan, aka The Golden Adonis, walks into my tattoo parlor, I know I'll do anything to make that man mine. There's an instant connection, a need to know more about him. Everything about him. But there's also a mystery surrounding the guy, when people look at him they only see the man that laughs, that cracks jokes and makes the world think that everything's okay, but I see the truth... I see the darkness that lurks so deep inside few would ever recognize it. I want to help him, I want to be with him, now I just have to make him trust me enough to let me in.\n\nIs Right Now\n\nI leaned my head back and thought about the boy who was no longer really a boy.\nAlex was a man.\nAnd a tall, really tall, one at that.\nThe moment IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d seen him walk through the door, my heart had constricted. Painfully. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d taken me a second to catch my breath. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d dreamed about him all through high school, watched as he took one girl after another out around town.\nI doubted he remembered the girl working the popcorn counter at the theater, but every weekend there was always a new girl on his arm, a new girl kissing him and rubbing her horny little body all over his, and it was a miracle my teeth hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t become filed points as much as IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d ground them together.\nAnd maybe it shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t surprise me that he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a clue who I was; I no longer looked even remotely similar to the girl whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d graduated valedictorian of J.J. Baines High.\nMy fingers twitched as I remembered the feel of his body in my fist. He was big, and so damn hard my thighs had trembled.\nFire and static and electricity and whatever other chemical combustion had detonated inside me. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d gone from zero to horny in two seconds the moment heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d walked in.\nHis hair had glinted so many different shades of blond, from white to burnished bronze, and all I wanted to do was touch it, run my fingers through it, wondering all the while if it was as soft as it'd looked. \nOne look into eyes that made me think of a sky right after a storm and I could no longer control myself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:084b9691f76643e11b1c9777086ddf003e9d60e0","amp;dn":"Marie+Hall+Right+Now+%28Moments+%232%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"084b9691f76643e11b1c9777086ddf003e9d60e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,75,150,145,247,102,67,225,27,28,151,119,8,109,223,0,62,157,96,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
