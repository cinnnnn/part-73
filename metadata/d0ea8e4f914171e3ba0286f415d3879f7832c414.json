Imperfect Spirituality\n\nCurtecy of Coast to Coast Am's wonderful  &quot;Coast Insider&quot; service!\nThis is  a full rip of the stream (WMA) that Coast to Coast AM provides to \n\nsuch loyal members to their shows. It has been converted and merged \n\ntogether into mp3 files, however, to give you the experience you should be \n\ngetting through the show mp3 archives. Instead, originally you get all \n\nbumper music erased, and a quality which takes out all bass (making George \n\nNoory sound as though he's coming through a crappy radio speaker)\nThis is what the Coast experience should be. And you can get it... \n\nabsolutely free. Enjoy!\n\nShow for: May 01, 2013\nShow description:\nHost:\nGeorge Noory\nGuests:\nF. William Engdahl, Anne Serling\nAuthor William Engdahl discussed potential new 'energy wars' in the \n\nMediterranean, issues around GMO crops, and how a group of global elite \n\nare gaining control over the world's oil, agriculture and currencies. &quot;The \n\nessential strategy of the cartel of banks and big oil companies...is to \n\ncreate a myth of energy scarcity...and one of the means to do that is \n\ncreating these wars,&quot; such as by taking countries like Iraq and Iran, \n\nwhich have huge untapped oil reserves, off the market for years, via wars \n\nor threats of war, he explained. \nFor the first time, we are beginning to see 'wars' over natural gas, as \n\nthe EU increasingly needs it to meet their mandate to reduce their carbon \n\nfootprint. Israel recently discovered huge reserves of natural gas \n\noffshore, and is becoming an energy player for the first time. Greece, \n\nCypress, and Lebanon have also discovered reserves, as well as Qatar, \n\nwhich has been making possible deals with Syria and Iran. &quot;Immediately, \n\nyou can begin to sense the geopolitical potential for wars in almost every \n\ndirection,&quot; he commented. \nGMO agriculture was started by the same interests that control Big Oil, \n\ncreating monopolies through vertical integration-- &quot;agribusinesses&quot; for \n\n20-30 giant multinational corporations, he detailed. With GMOs, foreign \n\nbacteria or elements are spliced into the DNA of soy or corn, and that's \n\nreleasing something inherently unstable-- it's fraudulent and reductive \n\nscience, he remarked. A recent long term study in France looked at rats \n\nfed a diet of Monsanto GMO corn for two years, and they found an alarming \n\nincidence of cancer tumors, organ damage, and early deaths. Monsanto's own \n\nstudies have never gone beyond 90 days, he noted. Engdahl believes the \n\nelite seek to drastically reduce Earth's population, via wars, disease, \n\nvaccines, and other methods. \nRemembering Rod Serling\nFirst hour guest, Anne Serling talked about her new book, As I Knew Him; \n\nMy Dad, Rod Serling, and her memories of growing up with the man behind \n\nThe Twilight Zone. Though he sometimes butted heads with sponsors and \n\ncensors, he was often able to slip in ideas about social and moral issues \n\nunder the radar through his sci-fi storytelling, she explained, adding \n\nthat he once said &quot;an alien could say what democrats or republicans \n\ncouldn't.&quot; She also spoke about how her father was traumatized by his \n\nexperiences in WWII, as well as his disappointment with his second series \n\nNight Gallery, which he felt didn't have as much to say about important \n\nissues like Twilight Zone did. \nNews segment guests: Douglas Hagmann, Jerome Corsi, Katherine Albrecht \nWebsite(s):\nengdahl.oilgeopolitics.net\nBook(s):\nA Century of War: Anglo-American Oil Politics and the New World Order\nGods of Money: Wall Street and the Death of the American Century \nMyths, Lies, and Oil Wars\nSeeds of Destruction\nAs I Knew Him: My Dad, Rod Serling ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0ea8e4f914171e3ba0286f415d3879f7832c414","amp;dn":"%28Full+stream%29+Coast+to+Coast+AM+05-01-2013+Energy+Wars%2C+GMOs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0ea8e4f914171e3ba0286f415d3879f7832c414","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,234,142,79,145,65,113,227,186,2,134,244,21,211,135,159,120,50,196,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
