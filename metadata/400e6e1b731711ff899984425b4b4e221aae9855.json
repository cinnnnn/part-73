The other additions are uppdates from shinobar. \n\n Unless some mistake is uncovered by users of these latest disk images/ISO files, I expect this to be the last update until we discover something that &quot;needs&quot; to be added, except that I will add the final version of libreoffice 4.1 (4.1.6) when it is released in May, affecting only the &quot;plus&quot; and &quot;libre&quot; versions. \n\n My preference is to focus on the main/original lupu ISOs and the super2 and super4 ISOs, as they are based on ubuntu kernels and seem to be the most popular. I am open to continuing any of the others, but encourage users to migrate to lupu, sulu2 or sulu4. Please let me know if there remain situations that are not adequately handled by them; I will resume support of any of the others actually needed by someone. \n\n And, as usual, I am open to continuing to work problems. If anyone develops a compatible kernel from the newest Ubuntu LTS, Trusty Tahr, I can take a shot at a &quot;super5&quot; hybrid lupu. \n Richard\n\n Mirror site  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://shino.pos.to/party/bridge.cgi?puppy/lupu/test/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://shino.pos.to/party/bridge.cgi?puppy/lupu/test/&lt;/a&gt; (shinobar)\n\n\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:400e6e1b731711ff899984425b4b4e221aae9855","amp;dn":"Puppy_Linux_Lupu_5.2.8.6_archive_23-Mar-2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"400e6e1b731711ff899984425b4b4e221aae9855","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,14,110,27,115,23,17,255,137,153,132,66,91,75,78,34,26,174,152,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
