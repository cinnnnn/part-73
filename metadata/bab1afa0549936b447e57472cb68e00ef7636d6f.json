Francis Wolff became involved shortly afterwards. It derives its name from the characteristic blue notes of jazz and the blues.\n\nHistorically, Blue Note has principally been associated with the hard bop style of jazz (mixing bebop with other forms of music including soul, blues, rhythm and blues and gospel). Horace Silver, Jimmy Smith, Freddie Hubbard, Lee Morgan, Art Blakey, Lou Donaldson, Donald Byrd, Grant Green, Hank Mobley and Freddie Redd were among the label's leading artists.\n\nThe label is currently owned by the Universal Music Group and in 2006 was expanded to fill the role of an umbrella label group bringing together a wide variety of then EMI-owned labels and imprints specializing in the growing market segment of music for adults.
