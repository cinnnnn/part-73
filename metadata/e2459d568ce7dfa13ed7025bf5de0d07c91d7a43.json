Produced by Quincy Jones, who fattened the teenager's sound with double-tracked vocals and intricate backup vocals and horns, she reeled off a few more big hits in 1963 and 1964, including &quot;Judy's Turn to Cry,&quot; &quot;She's a Fool,&quot; &quot;You Don't Own Me,&quot; &quot;That's the Way Boys Are,&quot; and &quot;Maybe I Know.&quot; She wasn't the most soulful girl group singer by a long shot, but she projected an archetype of female adolescent yearning. Her best songs survive as classics, particularly the irresistibly melodic &quot;Maybe I Know&quot; and &quot;Look of Love&quot; (both written by Ellie Greenwich and Jeff Barry) and &quot;You Don't Own Me,&quot; an anthem of independence with a feminist theme that was considerably advanced for early 1964.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/lesley-gore-p4387/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/lesley-gore-p4387/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Richie Unterberger):\n\nFifty-two-track double CD has all the hits and then some. It may seem excessive for those who only want the hits, and some of the selections (particularly from the late '60s) are weak. But Gore had more worthy B-sides, album cuts, and low-charting singles than most people assume, and there are a good number of those on this collection: &quot;Wonder Boy&quot; (a white Martha &amp; the Vandellas cop), &quot;Off and Running&quot; (covered by the Mindbenders in the To Sir with Love film), &quot;Look of Love&quot; (one of Greenwich-Barry's greatest girl-group-style songs), a cover of Laura Nyro's &quot;Wedding Bell Blues&quot; (which lost out on the charts to the Fifth Dimension's version), and interesting little-known compositions by Goffin-King, Paul Anka, Van McCoy, Marvin Hamlisch, and Lesley herself. Gore covered more territory than the teen self-pity anthems for which she's most remembered, and this anthology, while not enough to make you demand her election to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, is not nearly as relentlessly lightweight as her detractors would have you imagine. Includes some tracks that were previously unavailable on album, or previously unreleased in the U.S.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/its-my-party-the-mercury-anthology-r235602&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/its-my-party-the-mercury-anthology-r235602&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000001EMS&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000001EMS&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\nDisc 1:\n\n01.
