Tatsuya Nakadai stars as Lord Hidetora, a warlord who cedes authority over his vast dominion to his eldest son, setting off a familial power struggle for control of the kingdom. Majestic in scope, Ran is a visual masterpiece in which KuroÃ‚Â­sawa contrasts the immensity of war with the crumbling of one family under the weight of betrayal, greed, and the insatiable thirst for power.\n\nMenus-Yes\nExtras-Yes\n\nSpecial Features including\nAudio Commentary by Kurosawa scholar Stephen Prince\nAn Appreciation of the film by director Sidney Lumet\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\n\nLet's get this SEEDED people!!
