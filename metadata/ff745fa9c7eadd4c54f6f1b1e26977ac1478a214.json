Reid wrote for many R&amp;B acts in the 1960s and 1970s. As Blowfly, he has recorded numerous albums, mostly of sex-based parodies of other songs, but also including original sexually explicit songs. His stage name originated from his grandmother, who overheard him as a child singing &quot;Do the Twist&quot; as &quot;Suck My Dick&quot;, and said &quot;You is nastier than a blowfly.&quot;\n\nReid wrote and produced for artists including Betty Wright, Sam &amp; Dave, Gwen McCrae, Jimmy &quot;Bo&quot; Horne, Bobby Byrd, and KC &amp; the Sunshine Band. And he recorded many songs of his own in the '60s and '70s including &quot;Nobody But You Babe&quot;.\n\nReid would also write sexually explicit versions of hit songs for fun but only performed them for his friends at parties or in the studio. In 1971 he along with a band of studio musicians recorded a whole album of dirty songs under the name Blowfly. The album, The Weird World of Blowfly, features Reid dressed as a low-rent supervillain on its cover. Reid created this alter ego to protect his career as a songwriter. Reid continued to perform in bizarre costumes as his Blowfly character and continued to record sexually explicit albums throughout the 70s and 80s. The albums were widely popular as &quot;party records&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff745fa9c7eadd4c54f6f1b1e26977ac1478a214","amp;dn":"Clarence+Reid+-+Nobody+But+You+%281969%29+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff745fa9c7eadd4c54f6f1b1e26977ac1478a214","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,116,95,169,199,234,221,76,84,246,241,177,226,105,119,172,20,120,162,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
