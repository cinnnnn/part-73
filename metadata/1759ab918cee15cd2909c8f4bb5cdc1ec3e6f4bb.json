I made it because I couldn't find anything quite like it online. It has everything set up for multiple instruments in a way that is clean on the eyes. Just pop this file in your FL Studio Templates folder, open it up through the templates tab from within the DAW, and it will become your default template each time you open FL Studio up. \n\nDoesn't come preloaded with any samples, or any VST presets, so it's good to go for any set up so long as you're using FL Studio 10 or above. Each track on the mixer has a Parametric EQ 2 loaded on, and the master track has all the necessary plugins for final mastering. \n\n\nThe small file size is what it is. I could bloat the zip folder with unneeded stuff, but there is really no need.
