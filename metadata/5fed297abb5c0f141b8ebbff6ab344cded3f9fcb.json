After years of searching, scheming, and outright stealing every bit of research he can find on the subject, he's finally found a spell that can fix his connection to magic.\n\nThe people he stole it from are out for his head, naturally... but even if he stays ahead of them, he still needs to figure out how to cast it in the first place.\n\nIn a world where WWII was fought with magic, all bets are off as Cinder navigates the strange society of magical creatures, powerful wizards, and ordinary people that inhabit his world. \n\n\n&quot;Gutter Magic is a fantasy-fueled caper that mixes gun-slinging and spell-slinging. Fun stuff!&quot;\n- Jim Zub \n(Skullkickers, Street Fighter Legends) \n\n&quot;Weird and surprising, which is what this and are two of my favorite things in comics. And fun, which is the part that really matters. \nThere's not a lot of urban fantasy steampunk in comics, and Gutter Magic makes a good argument that we've been missing out.&quot;\n- Justin Jordan\n(Luther Strode, Team 7)\n\n&quot;Really entertaining stuff!&quot; \n- Joe Eisma \n(Morning Glories, Higher Earth)\n\n&quot;GUTTER MAGIC crafts a fantastical world that never was, but feels like it has always been, and infused our very real-world class disparity into the whimsical world of magic.&quot; \n- Rob Patey \n(AintItCool Comics)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fed297abb5c0f141b8ebbff6ab344cded3f9fcb","amp;dn":"Gutter+Magic+01+%28of+05%29.cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fed297abb5c0f141b8ebbff6ab344cded3f9fcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,237,41,122,187,92,15,20,27,142,187,255,106,179,68,205,237,63,159,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
