A formidable convoy launched in search of new livable planets. A convoy named Wake upon which one can encounter all manner of races, intelligences, peoples but where one race remains as yet unknown: human beings.\n\nThey are about to run into Navee, a feisty young girl shipwrecked on a lush uninhabited planet whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grown up and fended entirely for herself. Contrary to all on Wake who are either mind controllers or controlled, she is neither and that makes her very dangerous.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11d5e766206d61951f3d3b3440500091237bcf97","amp;dn":"Wake+Collected+Edition+%7C+%28Jean-Dean+Morvan%29+%5BEnglish%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11d5e766206d61951f3d3b3440500091237bcf97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,213,231,102,32,109,97,149,31,61,59,52,64,80,0,145,35,123,207,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
