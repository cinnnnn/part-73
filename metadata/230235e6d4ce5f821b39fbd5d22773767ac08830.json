MF, at the height of his popularity, was clearly looking for a hit, which is why he recorded &quot;Theme from Battlestar Galactica&quot; and roughly half of the poppish material on this rather forgettable effort. The trumpeter/bandleader would record worse albums than this LP, but this one is weak enough. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - M.F. Carnival\n02 - Fantasy\n03 - Theme From 'Battlestar Galactica'\n04 - Stella By Starlight\n05 - Birdland\n06 - Baker Street\n07 - How Ya Doin' Baby?\n08 - Over The Rainbow\n\nSplit with Medieval. Sorry.\nEnjoy and share!
