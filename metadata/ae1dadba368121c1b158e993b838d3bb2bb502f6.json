But 30 years of violence has left a bleak legacy.\n\nPolitically motivated 'disappearances' continue along with suppression of critical voices. The BBC's correspondent in Sri Lanka, Charles Haviland, reports for Our World on the lasting trauma for victims of the war who feel their voices are not being heard.\n\n\nHaviland  asks whether Sri Lanka can have the bright future its leaders promise if it does not address the darker aspects of the country's recent past, and its present.\n\nWith concerns over unresolved human rights issues from the civil war and a continuing atmosphere of repression, disappearances, sectarian unrest, staged xenophobic demonstrations,  and the murder of journalists, Europe, which imports 36% of Sri Lanka's foreign trade,  must reconsider its trade restrictions this year. \n\nThe Commonwealth conference will be held in November with Prince Charles representing the Queen among a number of countries asking to relocate this meeting.\n\n(Added description)\n\n\nFile Name ..........: Our.World.Sri.Lanka's.Open.Wounds-tbz.avi\n\n\nCap:  ottopilot\nSource: http://thebox.bz/details.php?id=229429\n\nshunster ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae1dadba368121c1b158e993b838d3bb2bb502f6","amp;dn":"Sri+Lanka%27s+Open+Wounds+++2013++05++BBC+Our+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae1dadba368121c1b158e993b838d3bb2bb502f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,29,173,186,54,129,33,193,177,88,233,147,184,56,211,187,43,181,2,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
