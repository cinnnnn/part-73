Pascal's already precarious ties to Agnes are strained further when he meets and falls for her fellow schoolteacher friend Cecile. With Pascal focused on Bruno and Cecile, Agnes is forced to find a fix on her own.\n\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English / Spanish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7edb7718d410962f2def7af1b4d471d28531d296","amp;dn":"Apres+la+Vie+aka+After+Life+2002+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7edb7718d410962f2def7af1b4d471d28531d296","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,219,119,24,212,16,150,47,45,239,122,241,180,212,113,210,133,49,210,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
