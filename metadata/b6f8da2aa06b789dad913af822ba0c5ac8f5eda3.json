Rick and his fellow survivors struggle to maintain their idealistic lifestyle in the prison in the face of threats, including the proliferation of walkers near the prison gates, the outbreak of a contagious and deadly flu-like infection within the prison population, and the spectre of The Governor, whose whereabouts and status are unknown and, unbeknownst to the prison community, is planning his revenge upon meeting a new family and rallying a new army. The second half of the season mainly focuses on the individual groups that escaped from the prison after its downfall, and their efforts to survive as they follow a line of railroad tracks to a supposed safe zone named Terminus.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6f8da2aa06b789dad913af822ba0c5ac8f5eda3","amp;dn":"The+Walking+Dead+Season+4+%5Bx264%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6f8da2aa06b789dad913af822ba0c5ac8f5eda3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,248,218,42,160,107,120,157,173,145,58,248,34,186,12,90,200,245,237,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
