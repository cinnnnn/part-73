Rats are growing more and more popular as pets for adults and children alike. Having raised and trained rats for over forty years, Miriam Fields-Babineau, in her book Rat Training, teaches rat owners to harness that intelligence through a reward and clicker system of training. \n\nAn avid proponent of reward-based positive-training techniques, the author explains how to create a successful learning environment for your rat as you teach him how to come on command, jump through a hoop, walk on a leash, stand on his hind legs, and much more. Illustrated with color photographs by Evan Cohen and Virginia Broitman, Rat Training includes tips on what to look for when buying a rat, how to care for your new pet, and how to acclimate your rat to other household pets. \n\nIn the chapter called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rat Manner,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the author describes how rats think and their social organizations and behavior. Fields-Babineau has trained rats for various purposes, including working in movies, and her chapter called Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Great Rat RaceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ describes the demands of rat shows and acting careers for rats. The chapter called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Scurry and HurryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is devoted to agility training and trick training (such as shoulder riding). Resources and glossary included.\n\nGenre: Non Fiction , Animals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6c7380001821f0f1b2f60719aab134c157b2cdc","amp;dn":"Rat+Training%3A+A+Comprehensive+Beginner%27s+Guide","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6c7380001821f0f1b2f60719aab134c157b2cdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,199,56,0,1,130,31,15,27,47,96,113,154,171,19,76,21,123,44,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
