Politically incorrect from the title cards on (look at the lips on those natives!), the film also serves as a reminder of Americans changing tastes in humor.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29747a8233dc2fb05940495f157774eefa0baadf","amp;dn":"Road+to+Zanzibar+%281941%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29747a8233dc2fb05940495f157774eefa0baadf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,116,122,130,51,220,47,176,89,64,73,95,21,119,116,238,250,11,170,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
