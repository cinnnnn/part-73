Produced by famously flamboyant studio wizard Roy Thomas Baker (Queen, Foreigner, Journey, The Darkness) it displayed a sound that utilized everything and the kitchen sink - bombastic and grandiose, no stone was left unturned to achieve maximum sonic effect. Indeed, it was a record that found media cognoscenti such as Alan Freeman, Geoff Barton, Nicky Horne and John Peel falling over themselves to recommend it. Everything about this record is so right, so impressive and so gigantically over the top that nothing has come close to its grandeur since. Featuring future UFO guitarist Paul Chapman and containing such highfalutin tracks as ''Flying In The Reel'', ''Spaceships'', ''A Million Stars'' and a monster interpretation of the Beatles ''She Said, She Said'', the album scores a suitably impressive eleven on a ten scale. \n\n\n1.
