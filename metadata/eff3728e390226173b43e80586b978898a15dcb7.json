We meet the remarkable series of leading writers and philosophers with whom Derrida struck up a friendship: Louis Althusser, Emmanuel Levinas, Jean Genet, and HÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ¨ne Cixous, among others. We also witness an equally long series of often brutal polemics fought over crucial issues with thinkers such as Michel Foucault, Jacques Lacan, John R. Searle, and JÃƒÂ¼rgen Habermas, as well as several controversies that went far beyond academia, the best known of which concerned Heidegger and Paul de Man. We follow a series of courageous political commitments in support of Nelson Mandela, illegal immigrants, and gay marriage. And we watch as a concept -- deconstruction -- takes wing and exerts an extraordinary influence way beyond the philosophical world, on literary studies, architecture, law, theology, feminism, queer theory, and postcolonial studies.\n\nIn writing this compelling and authoritative biography, BenoÃƒÂ®t Peeters talked to over a hundred individuals who knew and worked with Derrida.Ã‚Â  He is also the first person to make use of the huge personal archive built up by Derrida throughout his life and of his extensive correspondence.Ã‚Â  Peeters' book gives us a new and deeper understanding of the man who will perhaps be seen as the major philosopher of the second half of the twentieth century.\n\n\nReviews\n\n&quot;Exhaustive and exhilarating.&quot; -- The Scotsman\n\n&quot;Lucid, intelligent and richly informative.&quot; -- Times Literary Supplement\n\n&quot;Peeters has ransacked the voluminous Derrida archives and interviewed scores of his friends and colleagues. The result is a marvellously compelling account, lucidly translated by Andrew Brown. The man who emerges from this portrait is an agonised soul with sudden outbreaks of gaiety, an astonishingly original thinker with more than a dash of vanity who nevertheless made himself fully available to the humblest student.&quot; -- Terry Eagleton, The Guardian\n\n&quot;Peeters is not a Derridean, but his book has qualities Derrida might have appreciated, above all a supreme patience with intellectual difficulty and abstention from moral judgement. He has done a heroic amount of research, interviewing more than a hundred of Derrida's friends and associates. He also had the co-operation of Derrida's widow, Marguerite. But his principal source of information is Derrida's own writing... Derrida saved everything he wrote: he regarded every scrap as a 'trace', an almost sacred emblem of survival - and all writing, from poetry to post-its, had philosophical implications. Peeters puts Derrida's professional writing and these traces on an equal footing, using the one to illuminate the other. We see his many sides: a loyal friend and irrepressible seducer; a critic of dogma who couldn't bring himself to admit his own errors; a man who loathed tribalism but was so thin-skinned and so in need of adoration that he ended up leading his own academic tribe.&quot; -- London Review of Books\n\n&quot;Peeters has cut through a lot of the myth and mystique surrounding Derrida. There is probably more illuminating information here -- and correspondence -- than has ever been made public before... Peeters's Derrida is vulnerable, sensitive, prone to bouts of melancholia, neurotic, hypochondriac, and verging on suicidal. He is as tormented and torn as his prose. This is Derrida the poetic soul.&quot; -- Literary Review\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eff3728e390226173b43e80586b978898a15dcb7","amp;dn":"Benoit+Peeters+-+Derrida%3A+A+Biography+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eff3728e390226173b43e80586b978898a15dcb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,243,114,142,57,2,38,23,59,67,232,5,134,185,120,137,138,21,220,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
