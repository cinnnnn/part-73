And yet Ã¢â‚¬â€ from the media's &quot;world-expert microbiologist&quot; with a mail-order Ph.D. in his garden shed laboratory, and via multiple health scares and miracle cures Ã¢â‚¬â€ we are constantly bombarded with inaccurate, contradictory, and\n\nsometimes even misleading information.\nUntil now. Ben Goldacre masterfully dismantles the questionable science behind some of the great drug trials, court cases, and missed opportunities of our time, but he also goes further: out of the bullshit, he shows us the fascinating story of how we know what we know, and gives us the tools to uncover bad science for ourselves.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:752b957fe81a4300676a30683edd2c8ea3027ff7","amp;dn":"Bad+Science+Quacks%2C+Hacks%2C+and+Big+Pharma+Flacks%5BMersaletoPa%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"752b957fe81a4300676a30683edd2c8ea3027ff7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,43,149,127,232,26,67,0,103,106,48,104,62,221,44,142,163,2,127,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
