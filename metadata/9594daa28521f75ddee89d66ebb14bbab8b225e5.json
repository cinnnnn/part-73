The battle has escalated, spilling over to the mortal world of Midgard and now a Champion must be found, a warrior that can sway this war, which threatens the fate of Asgard and the gods themselves.\n\nThe Goddess Hel Ã¢â‚¬â€œ daughter of Loki, Norse god of mischief, has been banished from the heavenly kingdom of Asgard for defying OdinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rule. Angry at her fate, she seeks to release the ancient wolf-god Fenrir, which legend tells will bring about Ragnarok - the apocalyptic battle that will destroy Asgard and the gods. With her army of resurrected Viking warriors, Hel marches on the unsuspecting mortal realm of Midgard.\n\nFreya, Goddess of war, is appointed the task of stopping Hel and defending the future of mankind. For her champion she chooses Skarin, a great but troubled young warrior, ignorant of the true reason for his favour with the Gods and thrust into the midst of their bitter war.\n\nAs the player strikes down Hel she screams, &quot;You have not freed Midgard!&quot; The player then sees Skarin asking for his place in Valhalla but is refused by Freya, causing Skarin to release Fenrir and begin Ragnarok. A cutscene then states that, although the gods have been destroyed and men now make their own decisions, the essence of the gods is nevertheless still present.\n\n\n\nInstall Notes:\n\nRun Setup.exe\nPlay game from desktop shortcut\n\nMore info and support here : aviara ro\n\n[img]http://s23.postimg.org/gwr3kgf0b/viking_1.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://s10.postimg.org/p6wgvj8hl/Viking_2.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://s17.postimg.org/kjg2vsmen/viking3.jpg[/img]\n\n\n\nWe are looking for nice coders\nWe are looking for seeders\nWe are looking for people who could help us\nWe are looking for Games Helpers\nwe are looking for people with seedbox\n\n\nIf you think you are one of those contact us at \n\n\nHow To Get Your Maxspeed (uTorrent)\n\nTorrent Client - Preferences - Bandwidth - Number of connections - Set aprox. 500 for each\nTorrent Client - Preferences - BiTorrent - Protocol Encryption - Forced\nBandwidth Allocation - High (Set download/upload limit - Unlimited)\nStop Other Active Torrents - Start downloading and wait for connections.\nEnjoy and Seed for at least 1:1 ratio.
