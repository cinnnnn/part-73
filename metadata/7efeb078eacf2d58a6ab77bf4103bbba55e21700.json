The chances of this phenomenon happening by sheer chance is remarkably small. Did the ancient Egyptians know what the number pi was? Not likely, seeing as it was a number not calculated accurately to the fourth digit until the 6th century, and the pyramids calculate it to the fifteenth.\n\n\nWhat about the fact that even though the sides of the base of the pyramid are some 757 feet long, it still forms an almost perfect square? Every angle in the base is exactly 90 degrees. In fact, the sides have a difference in length of something like two centimeters, which is an incredibly small amount.\n\n\nWhat about the fact that although the Egyptians kept very careful records about everything they ever did; every king they had, every war they fought, and every structure they built, there were no records of them ever having built the pyramids?\n\n\n\nWhat about the fact that the Egyptians had not even invented the wheel yet, but the blocks that they had to carry to build the pyramids weighed about 2 tons each? 4,000 lbs.? What did they do... use cement? In fact, they used so much stone, that if you took all of the stone they used and cut it into 1 foot square blocks, it would extend 2/3 of the way around the earth!!!\n\n\nIf you take the line of longitude that the pyramid lies on and the latitude that the pyramid lies on, 31 degrees north by 31 degrees west (the fact that they are the same number is a coincidence???) they are the two lines that cover the most combined land area in the world. In essence, the pyramid is the center of all of the land mass of the whole earth!!!!\n\n\nHow about the fact that a group of modern scientists attempted to build a pyramid out next to the real one using modern technologies, and after something like 100 days, succeeded in building one about 1/40 of the size of the real one????\n\n\nDid you know that the height of the pyramid (481 feet) is almost exactly 1/1,000,000,000 of the distance from the earth to the sun (480.6 billion feet)?\n\n\nWhat about all of that fungi that was found in King Tutu's chamber? Fungi which has never before been seen on earth? What about the Pharaoh's curse????? You decide, who built the Pyramids?????\n\nAliens have definitely constructed the pyramids, so what have the Egyptians done on this earth?\n\n\nArchaeologists\n\nHead of the Cairo University Archaeology Department, Dr Ala Shaheen in December 2010 had told an audience that there might be truth to the theory that aliens helped the ancient Egyptians build the oldest of pyramids, the Pyramids of Giza.\n\nOn being further questioned by Mr Marek Novak, a delegate from Poland as to whether the pyramid might still contain alien technology or even a UFO with its structure, Dr Shaheen, was vague and replied Ã¢â‚¬Å“I can not confirm or deny this, but there is something inside the pyramid that is Ã¢â‚¬Å“not of this worldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nDelegates to the conference on ancient Egyptian architecture were left shocked, however Dr Shaheen had refused to comment further or elaborate on his UFO and alien related statements.\n\nDown below is 90's The Secret KGB UFO Files documentary, that's deals with the fact that Russian had already discovered the tomb of Alien Humanoid in Egypt and something is beneath the pyramid. The Secret KGB UFO Files documentary interestingly supporting the head of the Cairo University Archaeology Department, Dr Ala Shaheen claim as well.\n\nActually ancient Egyptian writings very often talk of beings from the sky, the sky opening and bright lights coming down to teach them technology and give them wisdom. Many pictures and symbols resemble UFOs and aliens. POSSIBLY aliens built the Great Pyramid. And these solid long lasting construction techniques were adopted by the Egyptians.\n\nAncient Egyptian legends tell of Tep Zepi, or the Ã¢â‚¬Å“first timeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. This is described as an age when Ã¢â‚¬Å“sky godsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ came down to Earth and raised the land from mud and water.\n\nThey supposedly flew through the air in flying Ã¢â‚¬Å“boatsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and brought laws and wisdom to man through a royal line of Pharaohs. And of course, this was all thrown out the window when Christianity came along. Keep in mind that the Gods were the one and only Ã¢â‚¬ËœreligionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ that there was. No other conflicting beliefs? Why? Well because it was fact, not faith.\n\nThe modern church would have you believe thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just a myth. But you have to ask yourself on the edge of Occam razor, what truly indeed is more likely?\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7efeb078eacf2d58a6ab77bf4103bbba55e21700","amp;dn":"N+O+A+H+S++-++A+R+K++-++Part+17+-++Did+Giants+or+Angels+Build+Th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7efeb078eacf2d58a6ab77bf4103bbba55e21700","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,254,176,120,234,207,45,88,166,171,119,191,65,3,187,186,85,226,23,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
