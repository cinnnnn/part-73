I will be enjoying that discography as time allows me to.\n\n\nThis UP includes (2) sextet sessions from 1957.  Famed participants include\n\nBill Evans, Oscar Pettiford, Paul Chambers, Benny Golson and Phil Woods.\n\n\n\n\nFROM &quot;liner&quot;FOLDOUT (included):   &quot;Sahib Shihab is a big man around his big horn!\n\nA virile bop exponent who can play with such a vengeance that he practically rips\n\nthe notes right out of the listener's stomach in the intensity of his \n\nswinging..........&quot;\n\n\n\nHyperbole?   I sure hope so...my stomach's doing just fine the way it is\n\n\n\nPS: my use of USB flash (thumb) drives has slowed things down but I'll try to\n\nmake amends\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:471d1d9a0c54bb5a3e9a12233a3e7513f81df28e","amp;dn":"Sahib+Shihab%2CJAZZ+SAHIB%2Csextets%2C1957%2CBill+Evans%2CBenny+Golson%2CSAV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"471d1d9a0c54bb5a3e9a12233a3e7513f81df28e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,29,29,154,12,84,187,90,62,154,18,35,58,62,117,19,248,29,242,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
