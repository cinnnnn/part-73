He brings in Dr. John to play organ on &quot;Love, Life and Money&quot; and, more prominently, piano on &quot;Tin Pan Alley.&quot; He plays a National steel guitar on &quot;Bad Girl Blues&quot; (a blues about lesbians!) and uses his slide with another National on &quot;Evil on My Mind.&quot; And, most significant, he reunites with his old rhythm section of bass player Tommy Shannon and drummer Uncle John &quot;Red&quot; Turner (with whom he played from the late Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ60s to 1970) on &quot;See See Baby,&quot; &quot;Shake Your Moneymaker,&quot; and &quot;Broke and Lonely.&quot; Particularly on those three tracks, he sounds like the blues-rock singer/guitarist who garnered so much attention when he first emerged from Texas as an &quot;overnight&quot; national star in 1969. Those days have passed, but Winter has matured into a dependable blues musician able to shine in a variety of styles and bring out the best in his fellow musicians. \n\n\nRelease Date\n 1986 \n\nDuration\n43:53 \n\nGenre\n\nPop/Rock\nBlues\n\n\nStyles\n\nBlues-Rock\nModern Electric Blues\nModern Electric Texas Blues\nRegional Blues\nSlide Guitar Blues\nAlbum Rock\nHard Rock\nArena Rock\nBoogie Rock\nElectric Blues\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9667ab37c6614292d40c717d2a9356db2c44a6f","amp;dn":"1986-+Johnny+Winter+++%26lrm%3B%26ndash%3B+3rd+Degree%5BVINYL+24%2F192%5Dsidma","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9667ab37c6614292d40c717d2a9356db2c44a6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,102,122,179,124,102,20,41,45,64,199,23,210,169,53,109,178,196,74,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
