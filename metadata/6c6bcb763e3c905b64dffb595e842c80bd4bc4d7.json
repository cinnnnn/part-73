The guys have a more mature and uniquely defined sound this time around. Still packing the same energy as before, the sound of this album is largely due to the new collaborative writing process developed over the last year. Every one of the 10 tracks for Ã¢â‚¬Å“Batesian MimicryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was painstakingly written in a sweltering basement with democratic input and ideas. The merging of influences and styles led to a new sound that couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have happened in isolation. The result: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Batesian MimicryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ will be an album that challenges what you thought of hardcore, punk, screamo, and indie. It will have moments that might confuse you, but after a few listens, you'll be in love with those exact moments. This is an album that shows a vision from a band that is not content to conform and please, but would rather push and struggle to get their voice heard. So listen up!\n\nBuy here: http://www.interpunk.com/item.cfm?Item=68404","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c6bcb763e3c905b64dffb595e842c80bd4bc4d7","amp;dn":"Permanent+Black++-++Batestian+Mimicry++%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c6bcb763e3c905b64dffb595e842c80bd4bc4d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,107,203,118,62,60,144,91,100,223,251,89,94,132,44,128,189,75,196,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
