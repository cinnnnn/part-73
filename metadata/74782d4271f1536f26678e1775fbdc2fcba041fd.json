NTSC, 720x480-24.\n\nAdded: index files, for opening VOBs with Avidemux. Some screenshots. Extracted SRT subtitles, EN-ES-FR (not needed just to play the DVD). If you want to include this added stuff, you may need to fiddle with configuration before you burn to disc.\n\nNote on width-to height ratio:\nThe opening scenes are letterboxed, to preserve titles. The remainder is 4:3. If you think maybe it was really originally shot that way (with Panaflex cameras!), I have a real estate deal you might be interested in.\n\nSo if you are lucky enough to record a broadcast of the whole thing in widescreen, even on VHS, be a hero and be the first to share it.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74782d4271f1536f26678e1775fbdc2fcba041fd","amp;dn":"Summer+Lovers+%281982%29+DVD5+NTSC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74782d4271f1536f26678e1775fbdc2fcba041fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,120,45,66,113,241,83,111,38,103,142,23,117,251,220,47,203,160,65,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
