This second installment will cover layers 2 and 3 and is concerned with the key protocols and operations. It is meant to be a follow up to the first book in the sense that these are more advanced ideas that assume and/or build on the previous ideas. For example, it is difficult to understand routing without first understanding IP. This book will be written to a depth that will serve experts and those first learning about these topics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ce67a8fe9ff352efad5ec2ef389a1a5d0dfe6b4","amp;dn":"Packet+Guide+to+Routing+and+Switching.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ce67a8fe9ff352efad5ec2ef389a1a5d0dfe6b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,230,122,143,233,255,53,46,250,213,236,46,243,137,161,165,208,223,230,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
