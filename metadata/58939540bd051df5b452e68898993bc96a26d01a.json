Doubling on flugelhorn, Faddis avoids his upper register and performs ballads while backed by an ensemble arranged by Carlos Franzetti. The backup group consists of five reeds, trombone, a french horn, an occasional oboe or English horn player and a rhythm section. Faddis plays lyrically throughout but there are no exciting or stirring moments to be heard on the ten selections which include &quot;Sophisticated Lady,&quot; &quot;Speak Like a Child&quot; &quot;In Your Own Sweet Way&quot; and a medium-tempo &quot;Goodbye.&quot; A well-played and professionally arranged program but the overall results are rather forgettable.\n\nRELEASE DATE\nFebruary 1, 1998\nDURATION\n67:13\nGENRE\nJazz\nSTYLES\nBop\nNeo-Bop\nJazz Instrument\nTrumpet Jazz\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Remembrances-Jon-Faddis/dp/B000003GH9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Remembrances-Jon-Faddis/dp/B000003GH9&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58939540bd051df5b452e68898993bc96a26d01a","amp;dn":"+%5BSACD-R%5D%5BOF%5D+Jon+Faddis+-+Remembrances+-+1998%2F2003+%28Jazz%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58939540bd051df5b452e68898993bc96a26d01a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,147,149,64,189,5,29,245,180,82,230,136,152,153,59,201,106,38,208,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
