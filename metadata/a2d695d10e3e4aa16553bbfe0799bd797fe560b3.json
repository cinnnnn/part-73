Gets tedious right?\n\n\n\nPlease post some poop jokes to lighten the mood\n\n\nTwo turds were out for a walk.\n\nOne of them got run over.\n\nThen then the other one said &quot;C'mon diarrhea, let's go&quot; \n\n\nI told that one to one of my sister's kids during a Christmas dinner and he actually fell off his chair laughing. My sister did not like the joke though.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2d695d10e3e4aa16553bbfe0799bd797fe560b3","amp;dn":"0-Day+Week+of+2014.04.09","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2d695d10e3e4aa16553bbfe0799bd797fe560b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,214,149,209,14,62,74,161,101,83,187,254,7,153,189,121,127,229,96,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
