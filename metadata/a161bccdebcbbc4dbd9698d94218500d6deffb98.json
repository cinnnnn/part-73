Iron Sky game Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a proper space shooter Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is on itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s way, from an award winning multi-platinum selling game developer Reality Pump (Earth 2150, Two Worlds 2, etc.), is developing the official Iron Sky video game Iron Sky: Invasion, which will release on November on PC, Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.\n\nIron Sky: Invasion puts the player in the pilot seat of defending Earth from a sudden Nazi invasion Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from space. Even though Iron Sky: Invasion is a space simulator, the game contains major underlying theme of politics: everything, even defending your planet from Moon Nazis, requires skillful political maneuvers. You will need to know who you are fighting for, whose boots you are stepping on, and choose your friends Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or more importantly Ã¢â‚¬â€œ enemies carefully.\n\nReality Pump has been developing Iron Sky: Invasion in close connection with us Ã¢â‚¬â€œ weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been helping them to tie both the visuals and storyline tightly into the Iron Sky universe. Iron Sky: Invasion will utilize technology developed by Reality Pump Studios showcasing beautiful graphics and high-speed battle sequences. The Grace2 engine allows photorealistic renderings of hundreds of space ships, advanced destruction physics and sophisticated AI of piloting spacecraft. Additionally, Grace2 will show the game in stereoscopic 3D for all players with 3D TVÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and monitors.
