Whereas PPL7FE kept the old kernel 2.6.33.2 to maintain compatibility. This however comes with a price - many software cannot be functionally updated, for such reason, old versions were used.\n\nThird-party software added: \n Desktop Environment - XFCE 4.5.99.1 \n Pidgin 2.7.3 (chat client), Mozilla Firefox 20.0 (updated), Wine 1.3.31 (Windows emulator), Java 1.6.0_21, Python 2.6, GNU Image Manipulation Program 2.6 (photo editor), VLC 1.1.7 (media player), Openshot 1.2.2 (high-definition video editor), LibreOffice 4.0.2 (updated), GParted 0.5.1 (partitioning tool), Photorec 6.11.3 (file recovery tool), Testdisk 6.11.3 (partition recovery tool), safecopy 1.6 (CD/DVD recovery tool), Pscx-r 2009 (Playstation emulator), Dia 0.97 (diagram maker), Google Earth 5.1.3533.1731, Netpen 0.98 (whiteboarding tool), Audacity 1.3.7 (audio editor), Bombono 0.5.5 (DVD authoring tool), Gtkpod 0.99.12 (iPod manager), Kdenlive 0.7.71 (multifeature video editor), Asunder 1.9.3 (CD audio ripper), Gftp 2.0.19 (ftp client), psppire 2.6.2 (statistics software), scribus 1.3.3.13 (desktop publishing), Amaya 11 (Webpage editor), Geany 0.18 (Code IDE), Chromium 18.0.1025151 (web browser)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fe86f7057bc9b2c7b8a0011781b0e136718c797","amp;dn":"Puppy_Linux_Pinoy_Pup_Linux_archive","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fe86f7057bc9b2c7b8a0011781b0e136718c797","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,232,111,112,87,188,155,44,123,138,0,17,120,27,14,19,103,24,199,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
