Fishman forgot the words to Love You and scatted one verse, then sang, in near-perfect time: Ã¢â‚¬Å“I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t remember the words now / I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t remember the words / And it really doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t matter Ã¢â‚¬Ëœcause I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sing either / So who gives a fuck, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time for the vacuum cleaner.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ During the closing HYHU, Fishman introduced the band, and himself as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Henrietta.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Suzy included an extended jam segment after the first chorus. Trey seemed to end the song after the second chorus while the rest of the band continued to play. The jam after Suzy contained a Lizards tease from Trey.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:294788f4322c58c6dbe36b2d011114ba13118266","amp;dn":"Phish+-+2003-12-28+-+American+Airlines+Arena+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"294788f4322c58c6dbe36b2d011114ba13118266","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,71,136,244,50,44,88,198,219,227,107,45,1,17,20,186,19,17,130,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
