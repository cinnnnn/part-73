Recording sessions for the album took place at several recording locations in Philadelphia and New York City. Production was handled primarily by Questlove, record producer and drummer for the band.\n\nUndun incorporates neo soul and indie music elements. It is an existential concept album about the short, tragic life of fictional character Redford Stevens, set in urban poverty, and is told through a reverse-chronological narrative.\n\nThe album performed modestly on music charts and sold 112,000 copies in the United States. Upon its release, Undun received acclaim from music critics, who praised its existential subject matter, production quality, and the band's musicianship. It was included on several critics' year-end lists of best albums.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3b0554431050ad053a3b6e18ab1dec88d684913","amp;dn":"The+Roots+-+Undun+%282011%29+-+%28iTunes+Rip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3b0554431050ad053a3b6e18ab1dec88d684913","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,176,85,68,49,5,10,208,83,163,182,225,138,177,222,200,141,104,73,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
