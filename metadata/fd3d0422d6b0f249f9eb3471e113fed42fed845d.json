The perfect time to release an award show about games released in 2013. Here are the 2013 Vidya Gaem Awards. A lot of people worked on this and there are many names to thank however that's why the credits exist.\n\nThis is the same version that streamed on Twitch but without the preshow. The Twitch.TV stream cut off the intro skit and two of the intermission awards, however this version has fixed that.\n\nLicensed under Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 3.0","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd3d0422d6b0f249f9eb3471e113fed42fed845d","amp;dn":"2013+Vidya+Gaem+Awards","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd3d0422d6b0f249f9eb3471e113fed42fed845d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,61,4,34,214,176,242,73,249,235,52,113,225,19,254,212,47,237,132,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
