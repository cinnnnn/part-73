It is a straightforward, virile, actionpacked yarn with ample excitement and mounting drama.\n[img]http://www.freeimage.us/image-B9C3_53388C80.jpg[/img]\nStory is a simple clash between a stiff-lipped hero and a glowering villain. When Dirk Bogarde, with only six months to live, arrives in the township of Come Lucky in the Rockies to take up his grandfatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inheritance, a whole train of skulduggery is unleashed. \n\nSaid inheritance is CampbellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Kingdom, a valley which has been a problem child for some years. The old man obstinately insisted that it held oil. The local inhabitants invested their money in his idea. Meanwhile ruthless contractor Stanley Baker wants to flood the valley as part of a new hydro-electric scheme involving building of a new dam with inferior cement.\n\nThe plot unfolds slowly but gathers tremendous momentum, with the dam crashing a great thrill. The alleged Rockies were lensed brilliantly in Cortina by Ernest Steward. Director Ralph Thomas wisely resists the temptation to allow his characters to indulge in personal rough stuff. Film keeps fairly close to the novel [by Hammond Innes]\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 2.25gb\nDuration.... 01:41:56\nCodec.... h264\nFrame Width..... 1222\nFrame Height.... 720\nData Rate.... 2998kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 163kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4debacf1c0c35f24e97da37838381de2d673a2f","amp;dn":"Campbell%27s+Kingdom+1957+BrRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4debacf1c0c35f24e97da37838381de2d673a2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,222,186,207,28,12,53,242,78,151,218,55,131,131,129,222,45,103,58,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
