When Charlie moves into his new flat, he meets a colorful array of new characters, including a dominatrix and a skinhead yabo, witnesses a murder, and finds himself on the run from assassins and fixers sent by the highest levels of government. Shades of Howard Chaykin's Black Kiss and the hardboiled style of 100 Bullets, all with a very British (as in Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels British) accent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4083bdd8d36bf7adba50fda7291762b5c7f6d2a0","amp;dn":"Black+Charity+%7C+%28Bal+Spee%29+%5BGN%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4083bdd8d36bf7adba50fda7291762b5c7f6d2a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,131,189,216,211,107,247,173,186,80,253,167,41,23,98,181,199,246,210,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
