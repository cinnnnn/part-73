While fine-tuning Adobe Garamond, which was released in 1989, as a useful design suited to modern publishing, Slimbach started planning an entirely new interpretation of GaramondÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s designs based on the large range of unique sizes he had seen at the Plantin-Moretus and on the comparable italics cut by Robert Granjon, GaramondÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s contemporary.\nBy modeling Garamond Premier Pro on these hand-cut type sizes, Slimbach retained the varied optical size characteristics and freshness of the original designs while creating a practical 21st-century type family.\n\nGaramond Premier Pro contains an extensive glyph complement, including central European, Cyrillic, and Greek characters and is offered in five weights ranging from light to bold.\n\nBought this font and thought to share it!\n\nMore Fonts to Come!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f898881fc7d61692cc0e7a93a5ae5819ac0c9cf","amp;dn":"Font%3A+Garamond+Premier+Pro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f898881fc7d61692cc0e7a93a5ae5819ac0c9cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,137,136,129,252,125,97,105,44,192,231,169,58,90,229,129,154,192,201,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
