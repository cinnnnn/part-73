The runaway of the title story is a young woman who is incapable of leaving her husband. In another, a country girl emerging into the larger world via a job in a resort hotel discovers in a single moment of insight the limits and lies of passion. Three stories concern the same womanin the first, she escapes from teaching at a girls school into a wild love affair; in the second, she returns with her child to the home of her parents, whose marriage she finally begins to examine; and in the last, her vanished child turns up caught in the grip of a religious cult. In these and other stories Alice Munros understanding of the people about whom she writes makes their lives as real as our own.\n\nSeries: Audio Editions\nAudio CD: 1 pages\nPublisher: AudioGO; Unabridged edition (December 7, 2004)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1572704462\nISBN-13: 978-1572704466\n\nKymberly Dakin (Narrator)\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
