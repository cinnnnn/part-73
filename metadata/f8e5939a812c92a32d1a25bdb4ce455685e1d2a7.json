Broadcasts started at 10pm almost every Friday. It was a showcase for the nation's top jungle/drum and bass DJs.\n\nThese are the best jungle/drum and bass mixes that I have ever heard. Some are not great quality due to the method of recording, but the track selection and production quality on the original programs are unparalleled.
