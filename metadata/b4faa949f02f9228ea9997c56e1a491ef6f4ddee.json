Simplicity Linux 14.4 is based on Slacko 5.6.5.6 by 01micko from the Puppy Linux community.\n\nSimplicity Linux 14.4 uses LXDE as the Window Manager for Netbook and Desktop Editions, and uses KDE 4.10 as the Window Manager for Simplicity X 14.4.  As usual, Netbook is a heavily cut down Linux distro which gives access to a browser, e-mail, and a few local based applications.  Netbook is designed for those who want to browse, check their e-mails, and perhaps look at a few photos or watch downloaded movies on their machines, but little else.  Desktop is designed for a fuller experience, and as such includes Dropbox, LibreOffice, Skype, and more local applications.  X is our experimental release.  It is designed to see what else we can do with Linux, with the intention being that features we like will filter down into the stable releases.  X should generally work, but should be considered highly experimental, and highly unstable; it is not really designed for day to day use.\n\nSimplicity Linux Netbook 14.4 Beta is available for download here: 246.4mb &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/simplicitylinux/files/simplicity14.4beta/NetbookBeta144.iso/download&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/simplicitylinux/files/simplicity14.4beta/NetbookBeta144.iso/download&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSimplicity Linux Desktop 14.4 Beta is available for download here: 559.4mb &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/simplicitylinux/files/simplicity14.4beta/DesktopBeta144.iso/download&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/simplicitylinux/files/simplicity14.4beta/DesktopBeta144.iso/download&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSimplicity Linux X 14.4 Beta is available for download here: 672.4mb &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/simplicitylinux/files/simplicity14.4beta/x144Beta.iso/download&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/simplicitylinux/files/simplicity14.4beta/x144Beta.iso/download&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4faa949f02f9228ea9997c56e1a491ef6f4ddee","amp;dn":"Puppy_Linux_Simplicity_Linux_archive_29-Mar-2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4faa949f02f9228ea9997c56e1a491ef6f4ddee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,250,169,73,240,47,146,40,234,153,151,197,110,26,73,30,246,244,221,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
