Brendan Rodgers led Swansea into the Premier League in 2011, and his Liverpool side take on his former employers at Anfield today. Tottenham are one of the form teams in the league on the road this season, and they make the journey to Norwich. Spurs began life after Gareth Bale with a 2-0 win over Norwich earlier this season and are looking for more of the same at Carrow Road. Meanwhile, Newcastle welcome Aston Villa to the north east.\n\n\nNotes\nCaptured and encoded at 50fps, which gives much more fluid and smoother movement. For my close friend in New Zealand but I though I'd share it with you good folk.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3717eac001bc88a3393601791d0533653200baf","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+2+2014-02-23+720p+50fps+HDTV+x264-wAm.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3717eac001bc88a3393601791d0533653200baf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,113,126,172,0,27,200,138,51,147,96,23,145,208,83,54,83,32,11,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
