Rooted in the two thousand-year-old wisdom of the Tao Te Ching--&quot;The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step&quot;--Kaizen is the art of making great and lasting change through small, steady increments. Kaizen is the tortoise versus the hare. Kaizen is the eleven Fortune 500 companies that significantly outperformed the market through moderate, step-by-step actions. Kaizen is losing weight not by a crash diet (which more often than not crashes) but by eating one bite less at each meal--then, a month later, eating two bites less. Kaizen is starting a life-changing exercise program by standing--just standing--on a treadmill for one minute a day.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a245b1445ea863eed577734b0374b183866a717","amp;dn":"One+Small+Step+Can+Change+Your+Life+-+Robert+Maurer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a245b1445ea863eed577734b0374b183866a717","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,36,91,20,69,234,134,62,237,87,119,52,176,55,75,24,56,102,167,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
