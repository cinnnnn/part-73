It probably comes down to the fact that I just might hear more new music in a week than most people do in 6 months, but the point is, I can get pretty jaded. That said, Otis GibbÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new album, Joe HillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ashes, walked into my head, didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t say a single word and whooped my blogger jadedness and said Ã¢â‚¬Å“You will love me now!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ And love it then, I did.\n\nWhen I wrote about OtisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ last album, When Grandpa Walked A Picket Line, I said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“if Todd Snider and Otis Gibbs could make a baby it would be the Woody Guthrie, Hunter S. Thompson and the Jack Kerouac of its generation.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ At the time I was pointing towards OtisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ political leanings and ToddÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wit. Joe HillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ashes has treated me to a brand new appreciation for OtisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ pure songwriting ability. That coupled with his voice, a voice that invites you into its sunny 78 degree porch for Old Fashioneds and asks you to stay and spin yarns, makes this an album that immediately feels comfortable. As awesome as that is, had this been the first Otis Smith Gibbs album IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d ever heard, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d have been more apt to juxtapose him with Seasick Steve.\n\nOkay, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m gonna gonna go old school with yÃ¢â‚¬â„¢all. If you were reading this site back in 2k7 you were really well versed in my midnight drunken ramblings sans an editor or a sober eye prior to posting so you should be (albeit: rusty) used to thisÃ¢â‚¬Â¦This album is fucking fantastic. I wanna be more Ã¢â‚¬Å“professionalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ about it, but I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stupid how good it is. If I were still getting a regular paycheck that allowed me to go to bars, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d be passing CD-RÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s (yes, I do that) of this album out to people, saying, Ã¢â‚¬Å“This album is by a guy called Otis Gibbs and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fucking fantastic!.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ If they asked what it sounded like IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d say, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Go home and listen to it, if you like it IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll pass along similar artists.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSo, Otis Gibbs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Joe HillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ashes. Fucking fantastic. Essential Listening.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:753ee1d3f2c275cad5c44e480466432791ff6dc5","amp;dn":"Otis+Gibbs+-+Joe+Hill%27s+Ashes+%5B2010%5D+%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"753ee1d3f2c275cad5c44e480466432791ff6dc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,62,225,211,242,194,117,202,213,196,78,72,4,102,67,39,145,255,109,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
