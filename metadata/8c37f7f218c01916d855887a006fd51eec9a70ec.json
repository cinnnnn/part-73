But in a very religious and conservative region of Darshan her passion is considered intolerable depravity and a sign of unacceptable morals for a young girl from a good family. When her father organizes a forced marriage to Phoree, a wealthy artisan, Dyssery takes control of her life and sets off an adventure through the Valley of Shadows where sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll meet, among other things, vampires, zombies, mummies and an obscene incubus named ZeblÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nThe Shadowrealm of Troy is a one-shot set in the Darshan region of Troy thousands of years before Lanfeust's adventures. It's a totally stand-alone adventure that doesn't require any additional reading.\n\nenjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c37f7f218c01916d855887a006fd51eec9a70ec","amp;dn":"The+Shadowrealm+of+Troy+%28One+Shot%29+%282011%29+%28Alice%29cbz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c37f7f218c01916d855887a006fd51eec9a70ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,55,247,242,24,192,25,22,216,85,136,122,0,111,213,30,236,154,112,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
