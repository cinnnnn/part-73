Alien ship crash lands on Mars, and a rescue team is sent out from Earth. (The plot thickens! :) Eventually a surviving female is located and brought on to the human ship. The female is light green with an amazing hair-do. After some unsuccessful attempts by the human crew to feed her, she is more or less left to herself. (Ominous, is it not?) While most of the crew sleeps, the Alien female hypnotizes the astronaut on guard. When the crew awakens, she is sleeping, and the guard is DEAD! Brief examination shows that the Alien ate his blood. THE QUEEN OF BLOOD! Naturally, there is a lot of blood plasma on the ship, so they feed the alien using that supply. When they are almost home, however, yet another crew member is eaten, a fight breaks out, and the alien is accidentally killed before she can finish the third guy. Phew! The ship lands on Earth, finally! But there is... \n\nSinopse Pt Br:\n\nO ano ÃƒÂ© 1990 e uma nave alienÃƒÂ­gena faz contato com a Terra , notificando uma visita iminente, mas a nave sofre um acidente e cai em Marte, entÃƒÂ£o uma missÃƒÂ£o de resgate ÃƒÂ© organizada na Terra para salvar os tripulantes alienigenas, e encontram apenas uma mulher sobrevivente.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d884b15fef0f59c3423120359142d9eeb88fc513","amp;dn":"Queen+Of+Blood+%5BJohn+Saxon%5D+%281966%29+DVDRip+Oldies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d884b15fef0f59c3423120359142d9eeb88fc513","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,132,177,95,239,15,89,195,66,49,32,53,145,66,217,238,184,143,197,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
