The recordings of Walter and Furtwangler (among many others) have defined Bruckner for me. The first time I heard a recording of Celibidache conducting the coda of Symphony 4, it instantly redefined that symphony for me. A few years later when the EMI recordings were released (after his death), I thought the EMI 4th was too slow at the end. But a few additional listenings convinced me that Celibidache was enabling a deeper understanding and feeling. He miraculously is able to display every detail of the score and maintain an intense feeling at the same time. It is this experience that I refer to as an x-ray of the soul of the music. This is especially true in the EMI recording of the 8th symphony. Once again I am focusing on the coda in the 4th movement. The tempo is here is slowed to at least half normal and every strand in the complex scoring seems to be laid bare. Yet the emotion and sense of the music are more intense than any other recording that I know (I have about 25 recordings of the 8th).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e037b39c431a98eb26017de201ddefe93a2b9435","amp;dn":"Bruckner+symphonies+3-9+Te+Deum%2C+Mass+f+moll","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e037b39c431a98eb26017de201ddefe93a2b9435","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,55,179,156,67,26,152,235,38,1,125,226,1,221,239,233,58,43,148,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
