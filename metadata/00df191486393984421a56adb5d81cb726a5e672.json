A 'Yes' vote in the referendum on Scottish independence would see the break-up of the 300-year-old union, adding a constitutional crisis to a deep economic crisis. \n\n An accessible polemic written for progressives both north and south of the border, Yes argues that independence can reinvigorate campaigns against austerity across Britain and deal a blow to the imperialist ambitions of the British state. An urgent and invigorating political intervention, Yes argues that even if the referendum result is 'no', a progressive independence campaign will alter the political landscape. Written by leading activists from the Radical Independence Campaign, Yes will be a unique contribution to the referendum debate.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00df191486393984421a56adb5d81cb726a5e672","amp;dn":"Yes%3A+The+Radical+Case+for+Scottish+Independence","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00df191486393984421a56adb5d81cb726a5e672","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,223,25,20,134,57,57,132,66,26,86,173,181,216,28,183,38,165,230,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
