In Teen Cyberbullying Investigated, Judge Tom Jacobs presents a powerful collection of landmark court cases involving teens and charges of cyberbullying, which includes: sending insulting or threatening emails, text, or instant messages directly to someone; spreading hateful comments about someone through emails, blogs, or chat rooms; stealing passwords and sending out threatening messages using a false identity; and building a Web site to target specific people. Each chapter features the seminal case and resulting decision, asks readers whether they agree with the decision, and urges them to think about how the decision affects their lives. Chapters also include related cases, important facts and statistics, and suggestions for further reading. With an ever-increasing number of serious cases of cyberbullying and school violence, this book is needed more urgently than ever.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1a07244142a1e0aee8f8a98a5acac34de7cbb6d","amp;dn":"Teen+Cyberbullying+Investigated+-+Thomas+A.+Jacobs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1a07244142a1e0aee8f8a98a5acac34de7cbb6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,160,114,68,20,42,30,10,238,143,138,152,165,172,172,52,222,124,187,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
