Two strangers dressed as minstrels (Arletty and Alain Cuny) arrive at a castle in advance of court festivities-and are revealed to be emissaries of the devil, dispatched to spread heartbreak and suffering. Their plans, however, are thwarted by an unexpected intrusion: human love. Often interpreted as an allegory for the Nazi occupation of France, during which it was made, Les Visiteurs Du Soir -wittily written by Jacques PrÃƒÂ©vert and Pierre Laroche, and elegantly designed by Alexandre Trauner and shot by Roger Hubert - is a moving and whimsical tale of love conquering all.\n\nMenus-Yes\nExtras-Yes\n\nSpecial Features including\nL'aventure Des Visiteurs Du Soir 2009 Documentary On The Making Of The Film\nTrailer\n\nLet's get this SEEDED people!!
