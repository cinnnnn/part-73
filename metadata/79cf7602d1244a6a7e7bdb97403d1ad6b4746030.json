They get retail sales information from record stores across the country and radio station airplay. They tabulate the data and then come up with their hot 100 list of the most popular singles. From that, Billboard's list of a hundred, we take the top 40 and count them down for you on American Top 40.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nThere is a song by the most successful songwriter in chart history. As of this countdown she had written 88 chart hits and 6 number one songs.\n\nA listener wants to know since the breakup of The Beatles, if John, Paul, George, and Ringo have ever occupied the top four spots on the chart? Casey says they did the next best thing, all four in the top 40 at the same time, then gives the details.\n\nThere is a song by the British group whose lead guitarist found the parts for his instrument in a trash can.\n\nA listener writes in: &quot;Dear Casey, Some people write words of music by themselves, others need a partner to help out, but in chart history, what song took the most people to write?&quot; Casey says it was a song called &quot;Ten Lonely Guys&quot; written by just as many song-writers.\n\nCasey tells how the band Nazareth, at number 8 with their song &quot;Love Hurts&quot; got its name from a song by The Band.\n\nAt the intro and outro of &quot;All By Myself&quot; by Eric Carmen at number 2, there is a distinct pitch change. That's the way it was broadcast, not my editing.\n\n40:    Boogie Fever - The Sylvers\n39:    Love Fire - Jigsaw\n38:    There's A Kind Of Hush (All Over The World) - The Carpenters        \n37:    Show Me The Way - Peter Frampton     \n36:    Only Love Is Real - Carole King     \n35:    Hold Back The Night - The Trammps    \n34:    Inseparable - Natalie Cole\n33:    Take It Like A Man - Bachman-Turner Overdrive\n32:    Good Hearted Woman - Waylon &amp; Willie\n31:    Love Is The Drug - Roxy Music\n30:    Action - Sweet\n29:    Love To Love You Baby - Donna Summer    \n28:    Let Your Love Flow - The Bellamy Brothers\n27:    Just You And I - Melissa Manchester\n26:    Tangerine - Salsoul Orchestra\n25:    Right Back Where We Started From - Maxine Nightingale\n24:    Cupid - Tony Orlando &amp; Dawn\n23:    Sweet Love - The Commodores\n22:    Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen\n21:    Only Sixteen - Dr. Hook\n20:    Slow Ride - Foghat\n19:    The White Knight - Cledus Maggard\n18:    Deep Purple - Donny &amp; Marie Osmond\n17:    You Sexy Thing - Hot Chocolate\n16:    Dream On - Aerosmith\n15:    Golden Years - David Bowie\nEXTRA: Ode To Billy Joe - Bobby Gentry\n14:    Fanny (Be Tender With My Love) - The Bee Gees\n13:    Money Honey - The Bay City Rollers\n12:    Disco Lady - Johnny Taylor\n11:    50 Ways To Leave Your Lover - Paul Simon\n10:    Junk Food Junkie - Larry Groce\n9:    Sweet Thing - Rufus featuring Chaka Khan\n8:    Love Hurts - Nazareth\n7:    Theme From &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot; - Rhythm Heritage\n6:    Lonely Night (Angel Face) - The Captain &amp; Tennille\nEXTRA: Daddy Don't You Walk So Fast - Wayne Newton\n5:    Dream Weaver - Gary Wright\n4:    Take It To The Limit - The Eagles\n3:    Love Machine (Part 1) - The Miracles\n2:    All By Myself - Eric Carmen\n1:    December 1963 (Oh What A Night) - The Four Seasons\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79cf7602d1244a6a7e7bdb97403d1ad6b4746030","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1976_March_13th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79cf7602d1244a6a7e7bdb97403d1ad6b4746030","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,207,118,2,209,36,74,106,126,123,219,151,64,61,26,214,180,116,96,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
