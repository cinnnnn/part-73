Macy, John C. Reilly, Tom Cruise, \nPhilip Baker Hall, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jason Robards, Alfred Molina, \nMelora Walters, Jeremy Blackman, Melinda Dillon, April Grace and Luis GuzmÃƒÂ¡n\n\n-----------------\n24 hours in L.A. Two parallel and intercut stories dramatize men about to die: \nboth are estranged from a grown child, both want to make contact, \nand neither child wants anything to do with dad. Earl Partridge's son is a charismatic misogynist; \nJimmy Gator's daughter is a cokehead and waif. A mild and caring nurse intercedes for Earl, \nreaching the son; a prayerful and upright beat cop meets the daughter, is attracted to her, \nand leads her toward a new calm. Meanwhile, guilt consumes Earl's young wife, while two whiz kids, \none grown and a loser and the other young and pressured, face their situations.\n\nIn this, his third feature, Anderson channels a little bit of Altman for an epic collision of \ntortured souls. Without question his most ambitious film he pulls it off without a hitch. \nAstonishing performances all around and flawless execution make this a modern masterpiece. \nFor some this film is too long, but with so much going on to me it feels closer to 2 hours than 3, \nand there is always something new to catch. It just doesn't get better than this modern epic about\nloneliness, alienation and the struggle to make sense of coincidence.\nAnd who knew Tom Cruise could act?\n\nAs a side note for those unaware; Robards was fighting cancer at the time of filming, which would claim his life within a year.\n-----------------\n\n\nRegion 1 (NTSC) DVD9\nRipped with no compression using DVDShrink 3.2\nSpecial Features on Disc 2; Not included here (Go Buy It)\n\nSubs: English\n\nMotion Picture Rating (MPAA): Rated R\nRuntime: 188 min\nAudio: 5.1 Surround and Stereo Suround\nAspect Ratio:  2.35:1\nRelease Date: 7 January 2000 (USA)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ccc21857c6a4183b2d9f6ef516ffab3e2f42582","amp;dn":"Magnolia+%281999%29+P.+T.+Anderson+%5BNTSC-DVD9%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ccc21857c6a4183b2d9f6ef516ffab3e2f42582","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,204,33,133,124,106,65,131,178,217,246,239,81,111,250,179,226,244,37,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
