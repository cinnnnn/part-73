We're living in a world of LES...\n\nLukewarm by Dr. John R. Rice:\nTHE CHURCH THAT MAKES OUR LORD SICK.\n1. Let me start out by saying that is far better to be ice-cold than lukewarm because at least a cold man realizes that he needs to warm up.\n2. Lukewarm church members are an embarrassment and a disgrace to the cause of Jesus Christ. The great Baptist preacher Vance Havner said, &quot;Nobody ever saw a lukewarm church with power. Anything is better than a tasteless tepidity. The cause of Christ has been hurt more by Sunday-morning bench warmers who pretend to love Christ, who call Him Lord but do not His commands, than by all the publicans and sinners.&quot;\n3. Another great man of God, G. Campbell Morgan, wrote these words: &quot;Lukewarmness is the worse form of blasphemyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦If there is anything abhorrent to the heart of Christ it is a tepid churchÃ¢â‚¬Â¦(But) this condition of being tepid is utterly repugnant to Him. No emotion, no enthusiasm, no urgency, no compassion.&quot;\n4. Notice that Morgan refers to churches with &quot;no emotion and no enthusiasm&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ this describes most churches today Ã¢â‚¬â€œ either they are crawling around on the floor barking like dogs and braying like jackasses or they are as dead as a doornail Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it is either wildfire or no fire. May God deliver us from these two extremes.\n5. Illustration: A Christian lady walked into one of these &quot;dry as a birdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nest&quot; churches one Sunday morning and was rebuked for praising the Lord.\n6. Do you know what turned William Booth into such a red-hot preacher? He was listening to an infidel give a lecture. The infidel said, &quot;If I believed what some of you Christians say you believe about eternal hellfire and the judgment of God, I would not rest day or night warning people about it. I would crawl on my hands and knees on broken glass all across London to warn people if I believed what you Christians say you believe about the fires of hell.&quot; That motivated William Booth Ã¢â‚¬â€œ by his own admission, he went from lukewarm to boiling hot, and then he started the Salvation Army. Of course, they have changed direction since then and are now preaching the social gospel but they were much different back then.\n7. When General Booth was an old man past the age of 80, the great evangelist J. Wilbur Chapman, asked him the secret of his success. General Booth started crying and replied, &quot;God has had all there was of me.&quot; Beloved, does God have all there is of you?\n8. We sometimes hear some folks say that we need more of the Holy Spirit. No, if you are saved than you have all the Holy Spirit there is Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the problem is that oftentimes He doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have all of you.\n9. Another problem today is that the majority of people who claim to be born again are not genuinely saved. The Bible says, &quot;Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new&quot; (II Cor.5:17).\n10. Our churches are filled with so-called &quot;carnal Christians&quot; and backslidden Christians who are not Christians at all. They have never been genuinely saved.\n11. I believe that another reason many churches are lukewarm because they have a namby-pamby compromiser for a pastor.\n12. Lukewarm churches are worldly. Someone once asked A.T. Pierson, a preacher well-known for advancing the work of missions, &quot;DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t you think that the world is getting converted already?&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; he replied, &quot;I admit that the world has become a little churchy, but the church has become immensely worldly.&quot;\n13. Something is seriously wrong when a church can get a big crowd for a picnic or softball game but no one shows up for soulwinning.\n14. Something is wrong when Christians make no effort to get out for prayer meeting, never give out tracts, never win souls to Christ, etc.\n\nHELL FIRE: The Most Powerful Sermon Ever!!!\nSermon preached by Pastor Charles Lawson, Temple Baptist Church, Knoxville, Tennessee.  He presents the Sermon on the Mount (from Matthew 5) the way it was intended to be preached, which liberals often twist for their own self-righteousness.\nwww.thelionofjudah.org\n\nFormer psychic medium meets God, hears the words 'Rise in Christ':\nStephanie Fruge provides her Testimony.  Her information may be shocking to some as she describes her former pagan lifestyle and witchcraft ceremonies being shockingly similar to the Roman Catholic churches ceremonies and other influences.\n\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\n\nMay Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.  \n\nDo Not believe anything you find here, search the Scriptures daily to determine the TRUTH.
