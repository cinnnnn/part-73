Leaked documents from Homeland Security reveal a joint DHS/FEMA national effort to counter on-line dissent against big government. The program is simply the latest by DHS in its effort to prepare for martial law while also characterizing libertarians and Constitutionalists as &quot;domestic extremists.&quot; \n\nIn other news, hospitals in the UK have incinerated over 15,000 aborted babies as &quot;clinical waste,&quot; with some being used to power hospital buildings. Even worse, parents of children lost due to health complications were not properly consulted on what would happen to their child's remains.\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
