Humanity needed to evolve, hell beasts needed to die, and Immortal races needed mates. Unfortunately, he found that he cared less about duty, and more about when his sexy voyeur would again grace the shadows to watch as he and his brother Guardian shared one of the human females frequenting the club. All Guardians were forbidden contact with the little goddess and her brothers, but his need for her was escalating. He found it more difficult than ever to keep from pinning her face down on the nearest surface, and making her his. \n\nAlexandra and her brothers have avoided exile from the human Realm for centuries, ever since the Creators sent the Gods to sleep for their sins against humanity, and banished the Immortals. She has always known that she was needed on Earth. Only once had she gone against her instincts and the price she paid will forever haunt her. It is for that reason she forces herself to stay away from the only male that has ever truly enticed her. The only one that has ever made her flesh heat, and her stomach quiver with desire. \n\nIn desperate need to help her beloved brother, she will have to go to the enthralling Guardian, her dark obsession. He is her best hope to get the help she needs, even though he would surely attempt to exile her. She won't go easilyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5302e997488a33278100d67f29e7cb745919983e","amp;dn":"Ecstasy+Unbound+%28The+Guardians+of+the+Realms+%231%29+-+Setta+Jay","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5302e997488a33278100d67f29e7cb745919983e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,2,233,151,72,138,51,39,129,0,214,127,41,231,203,116,89,25,152,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
