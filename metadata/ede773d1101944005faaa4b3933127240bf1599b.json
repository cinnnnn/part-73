Beware, this game might not be for everyone, becuase it's very retro.\n\nGo ahead and download, and try it out if you find it remotely interesting. It's basically a shmup with local cop-op capabilities.\n\nThis version, that I found in the hard drive, should be the latest version.\n\n\nIf you DO find this interesting, please consider visiting:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.indiedb.com/games/attack-of-the-crimson-marauders&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.indiedb.com/games/attack-of-the-crimson-marauders&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThis is totally NOT mandatory. Hope some of you have some fun :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ede773d1101944005faaa4b3933127240bf1599b","amp;dn":"Attack+of+the+Crimson+Marauders","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ede773d1101944005faaa4b3933127240bf1599b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,231,115,209,16,25,68,0,95,170,164,179,147,49,39,36,11,241,89,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
