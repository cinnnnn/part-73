We'll keep you updated as more details are available\n\nThe R.I.P. Files features a different kind of group of paranormal investigators, based in Washington DC, who use their psychic abilities and their deep knowledge of metaphysical techniques to interact with the entities they encounter at haunted locations. The group calls itself Research and Investigation of the Paranormal (R.I.P.).\n\nThese investigators encourage the spirits to share their stories in their own words through amazing EVPs and other evidence that is bridging the gap between the worlds of science and spirituality. Not just another ghost show, The R.I.P. Files explores the issues of life and death that we all must face.\n\nAs the investigators learn and grow in their profession, making new discoveries that push the boundaries of paranormal research even further, they also find themselves compelled to examine the effects of their activities on their own lives, on the lives of those around them, and on the spirits themselves.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1576f00cb5182e294c075e1f22c157ac7e8589f0","amp;dn":"The+R.I.P.+Files+xvid+-+USA+Paranormal+Reality+Show+%282011-2013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1576f00cb5182e294c075e1f22c157ac7e8589f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,118,240,12,181,24,46,41,76,7,94,31,34,193,87,172,126,133,137,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
