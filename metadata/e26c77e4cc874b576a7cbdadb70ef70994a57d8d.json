A third bunch of issues was published via\n         Halloween Comics, the author's own indie label. Finally, the series moved\n         to Image, which published a fourth bunch of issues and re-published some of\n         the second, the third, and some of the fourth bunches as trade volumes.\n\n         The HiFi proper is the digital trade edition of the first (Eclipse) run.\n         Single-issue editions of the second (Epic) and fourth (Image) runs are\n         included as bonuses. Unfortunately, most of the single-issue editions as\n         well as the trade edition of the third (Halloween) run have not been\n         scanned, which accounts for the six missing issues indicated in the title.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e26c77e4cc874b576a7cbdadb70ef70994a57d8d","amp;dn":"%5BHiFi%5D%5BDgtl%5D+Espers+%2820+of+26+issues%7CEclipse%2FEpic%2FImage%7C1986-98%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e26c77e4cc874b576a7cbdadb70ef70994a57d8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,108,119,228,204,135,75,87,106,124,189,173,183,14,247,9,148,165,125,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
