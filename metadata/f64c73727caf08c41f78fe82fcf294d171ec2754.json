Alex also examines how Ukraine's &quot;revolution&quot; guided them right into the hands of the IMF, the globalist organization that wrote the playbook on how to loot nations of their wealth and infrastructure. \n\nOn today's show, Alex speaks with world renowned relocation consultant, publisher of World Affairs Brief and author of Strategic Relocation: North American Guide to Safe Places, Joel Skousen about the developments in Crimea and Ukraine and how the global elite plan to pilfer the country dry. \n\nAlex also invites American political news commentator and editor-in-chief of The Daily Caller, Tucker Carlson to discuss why the public is tuning out mainstream news networks and turning in to real, unfiltered alternative and independent media.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
