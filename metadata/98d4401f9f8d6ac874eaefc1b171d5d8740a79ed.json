But when his cover is blown, his battalion abandons him and he ends up in the home of the Hinata family. There, he's forced to do household chores and sleep in a dark basement that was once supposedly a prison cell haunted by the ghost of an innocent girl. He even spends his free time assembling Gundam model kits. During his stay, Keroro meets up with subordinates who were also stranded during their failed invasion. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98d4401f9f8d6ac874eaefc1b171d5d8740a79ed","amp;dn":"Sergeant+Frog+Episodes+1+-+26+English+Dubbed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98d4401f9f8d6ac874eaefc1b171d5d8740a79ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,212,64,31,159,141,106,200,116,234,239,193,177,113,213,216,116,10,121,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
