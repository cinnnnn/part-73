Trust, after all, is no short sale in these cursed islands, especially not for a man tasked with finding the Treasure - an immaterial wealth said to manifest the beholder's wildest dreams.\n\nThe war has come home! While the bloody battle between GandoharÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s troops and the armies of the Orcs is raging in front of the gates of Oswaroth, the emperor waits in the depths of his palace on the outcome of the struggle for power. However, he does not know that an elite troop of Orcs, led by Rogdor, is making its way through secret paths into the fortress and is now close to the portals of the throne room.Two Worlds II: Castle Defense gives you the opportunity to slip into the role of the Emperor Gandohar and his henchman Sordahon! These villains from the &quot;Two Worlds&quot; universe are now playable for the first time ever in this strategy game, thus opening an entirely new perspective into the vast world of Antaloor.
