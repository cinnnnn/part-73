Born in Lebanon, Racy came to the US in 1968, where he earned his Masters and Doctorate degrees from the University of Illinois before accepting a position as Professor of Ethnimusicology at UCLA. His recordings for various labels provide a showcase for his mastery of the flute-like nay and the clarinet-like mijwiz, as well as the stringed instruments 'ud and buzuq, both important to Middle Eastern styles. Racy is currently working on a book tentatively titled The Art of Ecstacy in Arab Music. ~ Linda Kohanov, All Music Guide\n\n.: Recensione :.\n\n\na tribute composed and performed by Ali Jihad Racy.
