Though a few of his singles -- &quot;Rubber Ball,&quot; for one -- were as innocuous as anything else from the era, Vee had a knack for infectious Brill Building pop, thanks to his ebullient voice as well as the cadre of songwriters standing behind him.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bobby-vee-p5750/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bobby-vee-p5750/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Al Campbell):\n\nThe Very Best of Bobby Vee captures 30 of the teen idol's Brill Building pop songs originally recorded for Liberty in the early to mid-'60s, including &quot;Devil or Angel,&quot; &quot;Rubber Ball,&quot; &quot;The Night Has a Thousand Eyes,&quot; and Vee's biggest hit from 1962, &quot;Take Good Care of My Baby.&quot; The casual listener will be pleased with the choice of material presented on this disc, but collectors should check out the numerous two-fer reissues of Vee's original albums on Collectables and the U.K.-based Beat Goes On label.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-very-best-of-bobby-vee-r426508&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-very-best-of-bobby-vee-r426508&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000JJAU&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000JJAU&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
