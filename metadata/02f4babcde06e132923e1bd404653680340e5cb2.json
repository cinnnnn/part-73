Hey the actors, Joe Mantegna, Rutger Hauer and others got paid and we get to smile knowingly. I think the key to enjoying the film is just giving yourself over to it and accepting it as the mindless, &quot;I can't believe people are actually dumb enough to make a movie like this&quot; sort of way. It is dumb but if you go with it you may have a good time. To be certain this film probably should not have been released in 2001, but it appearance was purely a coincidence.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02f4babcde06e132923e1bd404653680340e5cb2","amp;dn":"Turbulence+3+Heavy+Metal+%282001%29+XviD+WEB-DLRip+NovaLan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02f4babcde06e132923e1bd404653680340e5cb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,244,186,188,222,6,225,50,146,62,27,212,4,101,54,128,52,14,92,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
