Indeed, St. Louis Cathedral across from Jackson Square stands as perhaps the most widely recognized face of New Orleans. The cathedral, though, is just one of many stunning churches that beautifully reflect the city's long and diverse Catholic heritage. Splendors of Faith showcases thirteen of these historic churches of exceptional architectural and artistic beauty, revealing scenic treasures that lie mostly beyond the well-worn tourist paths. \nThe earliest of the thirteen, St. Louis Cathedral, traces its origin to 1727. The most recent, Immaculate Conception, was built in 1930 but modeled after its mid-nineteenth-century predecessor. The eleven other churches are Blessed Francis Xavier Seelos, Holy Name of Jesus, Mater Dolorosa, Our Lady of the Rosary, St. Anthony of Padua, St. Francis of Assisi, St. Joseph, St. Mary's Assumption, St. Patrick, St. Peter Claver, and St. Stephen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db91bb76130ba4cf78ec6cf37dec47598bcd4ad9","amp;dn":"Splendors+of+Faith+-+New+Orleans+Catholic+Churches+1727-1930+%28Ar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db91bb76130ba4cf78ec6cf37dec47598bcd4ad9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,145,187,118,19,11,164,207,120,236,108,243,125,236,71,89,139,205,74,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
