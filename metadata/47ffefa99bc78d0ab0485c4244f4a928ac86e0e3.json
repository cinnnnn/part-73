In a time when others of Solamnia had become corrupt and self-serving, Sir Pirvan maintained the dignity of the Order, walking the fine line between personal codes of honor and loyalty, and diplomacy and duty.\n\nRoland J. Green is the author of the Starcruiser Shenandoah and Wandor series and numerous Conan novels, and is coauthor (with Jerr Pournelle) of the Jannisaries series.\n\nThe Warriors series details the exploits of the heroes and villains of the War of the Lance.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47ffefa99bc78d0ab0485c4244f4a928ac86e0e3","amp;dn":"Knights+of+the+Rose+-+Roland+Green+%28epub%29+%28steelballz%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47ffefa99bc78d0ab0485c4244f4a928ac86e0e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,255,239,169,155,199,141,10,176,72,92,66,68,244,169,40,172,134,224,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
