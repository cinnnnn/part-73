The film reveals the challenges faced by returning combat veterans, and the battle many must fight after they come home.\n\nIn 2003, filmmaker Dan Lohaus set off across the country to document the lives of homeless veterans, and listen to their stories. Many told Lohaus that they had come back to America haunted by their memories of combat, only to fight a new war at home. Nearly every homeless Vietnam veteran raised concerns about the new generation of soldiers returning home from combat in Iraq.\n\nWhen Lohaus found Iraq War veteran Herold Noel suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and living out of his car in Brooklyn, WHEN I CAME HOME became a film about history repeating itself. The film follows Herold's struggle with homelessness and PTSD, as he tries to get assistance from the V.A., city agencies, and different veterans' organizations.\n\nWHEN I CAME HOME exposes a failing system, and our veterans' fight for survival after returning home from war.\n\n&quot;Army marines, US navy, and army, when you see army recruiting stations in the middle of the ghetto, everybody sees that as a way out... if you go to the other direction, take cab down the other direction, you will see the other recruiting station down there, so they've got both sides blocked in the 'hood..&quot; ~ Herold Noel, Iraq war veteran \n\n&quot;When I was a little boy my nickname was sunshine, because I was always smiling. I came back a totally different person. Sometimes I see the faces of the people I killed, the kids.. Vietnam was still kicking my ass.. And I have to fight the V.A. just for the minimal of anything, and they all play crazy, I never get anything, so after awhile I get tired of hitting my head against that wall, just leave that wall alone. I don't see much hope, something I really want to die.&quot; ~ Vietnam veteran\n\n&quot;In the long run, there is no justice without freedom, and there can be no human rights without human liberty. Our nation relies on men and women, who look after a neighbor, and surround the lost with love. Even the unwanted have worth. Some have shown their devotion to our country, in deaths that honored their whole lives, and we will always honor their names, and their sacrifice. God bless you, and may He watch over the United States of America.&quot; (sic) ~ George W. Bush\n\n(NTSC 16:9)  Runtime: 71m\n\nwhenicamehome dawt com\n\nScreens: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/5viwqsn2l&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/5viwqsn2l&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/6q5gctux9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/6q5gctux9&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/hafdvezf1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/hafdvezf1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/o647s9j9p&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/o647s9j9p&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/yc87xiea5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/yc87xiea5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/y25arwp1p&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/y25arwp1p&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/lrcc7u30t&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/lrcc7u30t&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/jbaitzky5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/jbaitzky5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/l5ndbq7yl&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/l5ndbq7yl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/cyvdk5hvx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/cyvdk5hvx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/m2tskljgt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/m2tskljgt&lt;/a&gt;\n\n12.
