ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the dilemma facing Detective Inspector Rebecca Flint (Tamzin Outhwaite) and astrophysicist Dr Christian King (Emun Elliott) when a series of rogue images transmitted into his laboratory from space, throw them together.\n\nThe fragmented images appear to be of a major incident, but shockingly they suggest it has yet to happen; itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in the future. Christian, Rebecca and her team, DS Ben Holt (Mark Bonnar) and DC Callum Gada (ChikÃƒÂ© Okonkwo), have just 18 hours to work out the clues and prevent a tragedy.
