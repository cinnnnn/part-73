So far he's been lucky. But too much of a good thing makes a man careless; he gets sloppy, he lets down his guard. \n\nFrom bizarre arrest to explosive conclusion, Freak is a wild rollercoaster of a ride, featuring impossible escapes, a dizzying manhunt, and a gothic mini-movie of a courtroom confession, wherein you'll meet the real Nicolas Vilenov, slippery opportunist and soulless predator, bogeyman of a thousand suppressed dreams.\n\nGenre: Horror ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8a8c0983aee9a5cbdc0cc36faf37ce4d78f8faa","amp;dn":"Freak+by+Ron+Sanders","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8a8c0983aee9a5cbdc0cc36faf37ce4d78f8faa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,168,192,152,58,238,154,92,189,192,204,54,250,243,124,228,215,143,143,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
