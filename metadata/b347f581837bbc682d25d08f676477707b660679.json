You want to be a traveling gyspy. You want to wake up in a new city each day and see the stage lights sparkling in the eyes of new friends every night.\n\nAnd, guess what?\n\nI want you to have that too.\n\nThis little card is your all access pass to the entire tour. For the very first time, we are hiding Asylum cams on stage, and uploading photos and live show video to this little card's secret online area on the daily.\n\nYou will experience this show up close, capturing more detail than what most of the audience present at these shows could ever see. And, if you were at any of these shows, maybe you'll find yourself in the crowd!\n\nThis has never happened. But this is happenening. This card is your key. Welcome. Now, step inside...\n\nIt's show time.\n\n~ EA&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b347f581837bbc682d25d08f676477707b660679","amp;dn":"Emilie+Autumn+Tour+Files+FLAG+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b347f581837bbc682d25d08f676477707b660679","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,71,245,129,131,123,188,104,45,37,208,143,103,100,119,112,123,102,6,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
