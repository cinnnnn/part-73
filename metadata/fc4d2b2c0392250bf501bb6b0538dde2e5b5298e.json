Receivers can now run off the walls, change passing lanes by running your QB up a building, and take advantage of eye-popping wall jukes and all-new hurdles. You better hold on to the ball because defenders fly across the field in ways never before seen in a football game. Players now descend on Bay City, an all-new persistent world to build their teams, their reps, and their battle plans one field at a time. Once you own the walls, you will own the city. Join pick-up games around the city and establish your reputation by recruiting talent from the neighborhoods you conquer as you begin your journey to become football's biggest street legend. The time to own the streets is now.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc4d2b2c0392250bf501bb6b0538dde2e5b5298e","amp;dn":"NFL+Street+2+%28PS2%29+%28NTSC%29+%28Fabio5ilva%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc4d2b2c0392250bf501bb6b0538dde2e5b5298e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,77,43,44,3,146,37,11,245,1,187,107,5,56,221,226,229,181,41,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
