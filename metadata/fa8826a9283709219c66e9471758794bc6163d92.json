Set in 1909 London, when women were reveling in a new sense of freedom and modernity, it follows Harry Gordon Selfridge ('Mile a Minute Harry'), a man with a mission to make shopping as thrilling as sex. Pioneering and reckless, with an almost manic energy, Harry created a theater of retail where any topic or trend that was new, exciting, entertaining - or just eccentric - was showcased.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa8826a9283709219c66e9471758794bc6163d92","amp;dn":"Mr.Selfridge+S01E01-S01E10.Eng+srt+-Lindoff","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa8826a9283709219c66e9471758794bc6163d92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,136,38,169,40,55,9,33,156,102,233,71,23,88,121,75,198,22,61,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
