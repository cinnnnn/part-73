Padraig Dunne and Anne Marie Brain are in the Den to pitch their new theatre show 'The Cloak', and they're not alone -- they've brought some of the cast with them too! Cork man Martin Hanan runs the Alternative Pizza Company, and with flavour combinations including a bacon and cabbage pizza, it's certainly an apt title! They say that necessity is the mother of invention, and when San Diego native Nicole Gardiner realised that there were no trolley seat covers available for her toddler in Ireland, she decided to develop her own, and is in the Den to offer the Dragons a slice of her business Brand Newbies. Jewellery maker Mary Enright is in the Den seeking investment to expand her business ME Jewellery but is it different enough to hook a Dragon?\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 20-Apr-2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:213d571da4ed543622256b340526d4eee886156b","amp;dn":"Dragons.Den.Ireland.S06E05.HDTV.x264-spinzes.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"213d571da4ed543622256b340526d4eee886156b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,61,87,29,164,237,84,54,34,37,107,52,5,38,212,238,232,134,21,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
