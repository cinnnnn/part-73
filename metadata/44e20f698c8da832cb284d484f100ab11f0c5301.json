AndrÃƒÂ©a left the band shortly after its founding, before its first performance. However, d'Arnell left AndrÃƒÂ©a's name in the band name. Their music features proeminently keyboards, cello, and ChloÃƒÂ©'s vocals. The band is known for including a large collection or ensemble of musicians in its live performances and has performed at numerous international music festivals including Germany's Wave-Gotik-Treffen. Many of their albums have focused on late 19th and early 20th century themes.\n\nWhen the band signed with PrikosnovÃƒÂ©nie in 2002, the label re-edited and re-released many of the previous New Rose Records albums that had previously been out of print. Signing with PrikosnovÃƒÂ©nie also resulted in three new albums and a new tour schedule through Europe.\n\nList of band members:\n\nStudio and live:\n\nPascal AndrÃƒÂ©a (1986) -- co-founder\nJean-Christophe d'Arnell (1986Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent) -- co-founder, piano, keyboards, percussion\nChloÃƒÂ© St Liphard (1986Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent) -- co-founder, vocals\nCharlotte (1989) -- cello\nThierry Simonnet (1989) -- keyboards\nPeter Rakoto (1989Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1990) -- bass guitar\nXavier Gaschignard (1990Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent) -- cello\nFranz TorrÃƒÂ¨s-QuÃƒÂ©vÃƒÂ©do (1992Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent) -- guitar and bass guitar, also has been a member of O Quam Tristis, Opera Multi Steel, The Three Cold Men, and Thy Violent Vanities[2]\nStephan Kehlsen (1996) -- bass guitar\nCarine Grieg (present) -- keyboards, backing vocals, also a member of Opera Multi Steel, GantÃƒÂ¶k, and O Quam Tristis\nThibault d'Aboville (2002Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent) -- viola, also a member of GantÃƒÂ¶k and Lili Kunst\nVincent Maginen (2004Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent) -- electric guitar","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44e20f698c8da832cb284d484f100ab11f0c5301","amp;dn":"Collection+d%27Arnell-Andrea+-+9+Albums+%281989-2011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44e20f698c8da832cb284d484f100ab11f0c5301","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,226,15,105,140,141,168,50,203,40,77,72,79,16,10,177,31,12,83,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
