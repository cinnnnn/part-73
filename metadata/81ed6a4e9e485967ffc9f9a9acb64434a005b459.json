The music is raw-edged and rowdy, the breadth of performers impressive. The sound quality is very good on most all of the tracks, especially considering their age (most were recorded in the early to mid 1950's). The liner notes are extensive and provide an insight into many of the lesser-known performers of the era, most of whom I was previously unaware. Many of the licks heard in this collection are recognizable due to their adoption in later rock 'n' roll classics.\n(review, amazon.com)\n\n- - -\n\nVA - Jook Joint Blues - That's What They Want\n(4CD JSP Records UK 2007)\n\nDisc: 1\n\n 1.
