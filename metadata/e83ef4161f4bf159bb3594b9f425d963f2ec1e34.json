The system features a LAMP software bundle to host your chat server's &quot;Key Exchange&quot; web page (more on that later). \n\nNotes are included which will show you how to: \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Run your own RetroShare Chat Server in a Desktop environment from a live session CD, USB stick or virtual machine.\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Install the RetroShare Chat Server Live CD operating system on your computer's hard drive or a virtual machine disk.\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Compile your own customized RetroShare Chat Server.\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Install, backup and restore a Linux operating system.\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Build your own custom Linux Desktop installation and live cd.\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Create, backup and restore a multi-iso partitioned bootable usb stick.\n\n\nThe following PDFs are also included: \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢The Debian Administrator's Handbook\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢SANS Institute Linux Security Checklist\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPURPOSE\n\nRETROSHARE\n\nRetroShare can be used to chat and file share through a direct connection with your family and friends. \n\nOrganizations such as associations, clubs or groups can use RetroShare as a private &quot;members only&quot; network. \n\nCommunities can have local &quot;neighborhood&quot; RetroShare networks for events, ride sharing, yard sales, lost &amp; found, crime watches and services such as daycare, a singles scene or seniors outreach. \n\nAt this time, businesses can securely hold group chat conferences and transmit documents with employees who work remotely. It's possible that RetroShare will provide video conferencing in the future. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLINUX\n\nIf you've never tried Linux you can test run the operating system on your machine without having to make any changes to your computer. \n\nYou can explore Linux in a temporary environment called a &quot;live session&quot; where you will have the opportunity to learn about the operating system without being concerned about making a mistake. \n\nYou can &quot;conquer the unknown&quot; as you build your own installation with software to suit your needs. You'll become familiar with Linux &quot;lingo&quot; as you master backing-up and restoring your system. \n\nAnd in the end, I am confident you'll discover you can be a Linux user too! \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nRETROSHARE\n\nRetroShare is a free, open source, cross-platform, secure, decentralized communication platform. \n\nFeatures include chat, file-sharing, messages, forums and channels which are encrypted by 2,048-bit SSL keys. \n\nThe network is serverless which means without any dependencies on central servers or companies like Facebook, Yahoo!, MSN or Google. It's called a friend-to-friend (F2F) network where you connect directly and privately with your friends. \n\nRetroShare users become &quot;friends&quot; by exchanging PGP certificates (keys). Connections are then made using BitTorrent's Distributed Hash Table (DHT), a &quot;Discovery&quot; service in the F2F network or a Dynamic DNS service to locate your contacts. \n\nThe RetroShare Chat Server provides a web page interface where new users can make &quot;friends&quot; with your chat server. Once keys have been exchanged they will be able to connect to the network and access the chat lobby. \n\nRetroShare does not require installation. For Windows there is a portable version which can run on a usb stick. Linux users can compile the source then place it on a usb stick.

The Debian Project began in 1993 and has grown over the years into an organization of around 890 Debian Developers. \n\nDebian is known for its commitment to the Debian Social Contract which states that it will remain 100% free. Debian is currently the most significant distributor of Linux that is not a commercial entity.\n\nAs a result of its strictly guarded policies, a new distribution release for Debian tends to occur every one to two years. The strategy policies used by the Debian Project for minimizing software bugs has allowed it to remain one of the most stable and secure Linux distributions. \n\nDebian is seen as a solid Linux, and as a consequence has been used as a base for dozens of other Debian derivatives such as Ubuntu and Knoppix. \n\nFor more information:\n\nVisit: Debian Wheezy from Discovery to Mastery &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://debian-handbook.info&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://debian-handbook.info&lt;/a&gt; \n\nRead: The Debian GNU/Linux FAQ: Linux-Reference &gt; pdf &gt; debian-faq.en.pdf \n\nRead: The Debian Administrator's Handbook: Linux-Reference &gt; pdf &gt; debian-handbook.pdf \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLAMP (software bundle)\n\nWiki  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe acronym LAMP refers to the first letters of the four components of a solution stack, composed entirely of free and open-source software, suitable for building high-availability heavy-duty dynamic web sites, and capable of serving tens of thousands of requests simultaneously. \n\nNAME DESCRIPTION \nLinux The operating system \nApache HTTP Server, the web server \nMySQL The database management system \nPHP The scripting language used for dynamic web pages and web development \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLIVE\n\nA &quot;live cd&quot; contains an operating system that can boot without modifying any files on the hard drive. \n\nA &quot;live session&quot; runs in a computer's memory, rather than from a hard disk drive. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\nProcessor Architecture: i386 \n\nProcessor Speed: Minimum 1GHZ \n\nRAM: Minimum 1GB \n\nTo install: Minimum 4GB disk space (recommend 12GB) \n\nNote: The kernel is a program that constitutes the central core of a computer operating system. It has complete control over everything that occurs in the system. \n\nThe RetroShare Chat Server Live CD features a &quot;486&quot; kernel for use on older PCs with a single processor not supporting PAE. The maximum RAM capacity is 4GB. Note: This kernel can also be used with multi-core processors but will be limited to single core processing. \n\nIf you install this system on a disk, you have the option of installing the &quot;linux-image-3.2.0-4-686-pae&quot; kernel which is for use on modern PCs with one or more processors supporting PAE. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLANGUAGE: English \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYOUR ADVENTURE INTO THE WORLD OF LINUX IS ABOUT TO BEGIN.
