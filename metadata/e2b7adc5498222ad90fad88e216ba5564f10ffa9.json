Nearly a dozen years later, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve teamed again to pay tribute to an assortment of gifted songwriters from various musical genres.\n\nThey completely reshape Tom Petty and the HeartbreakersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ mid-tempo rocker Ã¢â‚¬Å“Even the LosersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ into a slow-burning piano ballad. While Warren HaynesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬Å“SoulshineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has been cut by two bands heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s associated withÃ¢â‚¬â€The Allman Brothers Band and GovÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t MuleÃ¢â‚¬â€Pat turns in a particularly soulful performance on the tune, aided by Monte Montgomery on vocals and some blistering guitar licks.\n\nOccasionally, the original artist is invited to help re-record a tune. Pat pairs with Collective Soul lead singer Ed Roland for a stripped-down, country-tinged version of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“The World I Know,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and trades lines with Aaron Lee Tasjan on AaronÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Streets of Galilee.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nPat and Cory round out the album with honorable takes on songs from fellow Texas songwriters Joe Ely (Ã¢â‚¬Å“All Just to Get to YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), Jon Randall (Ã¢â‚¬Å“AustinÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and Lyle Lovett (Ã¢â‚¬Å“If I Had a BoatÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2b7adc5498222ad90fad88e216ba5564f10ffa9","amp;dn":"Pat+Green+-+Songs+We+Wish+We%27d+Written+II+%5B2012%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2b7adc5498222ad90fad88e216ba5564f10ffa9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,183,173,197,73,130,34,173,144,250,216,142,33,107,165,86,79,16,255,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
