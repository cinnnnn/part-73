Lion DiskMaker for Mac lacks any other features, but completes this function well.\nThe free program downloaded and installed easily. Minimal instructions were included beyond a frequently asked questions section and it was not clear if technical support was available. At startup, Lion DiskMaker for Mac immediately asks which operating system the user would like to use, whether OS X 10.7 or 10.8. The menu is small, but uncomplicated and walks the user through the process. At first, the program stated during testing that no Mac installation file had been found, but after consulting the FAQ section, this was solved. After this was fixed, the program worked quickly, walking the user through the setup process. The program did install the OS image on the test USB, but booting from this device was not tested separately. The program also offers the option of creating a bootable DVD of the OS, which would be a welcome option for users who buy secondhand Macs or do not have their original recovery CD.\nWhile basically functional, Lion DiskMaker for Mac lacks many features that would make it useful to anyone other than those users who need a bootable USB or new CD of their Mac OS.\n\n\nRead more: DiskMaker X for Mac - Free download and software reviews - CNET Download.com http://download.cnet.com/DiskMaker-X/3000-18513_4-75715615.html#ixzz2uEOqNRnR\n\n-Michael Kan\n\nIf there is any problem, comment.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebf1a2a696313f22e1cc9ebc146178ba14e86a65","amp;dn":"Disk+Maker+X+%283.0.4%29+%5BOS+X%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebf1a2a696313f22e1cc9ebc146178ba14e86a65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,241,162,166,150,49,63,34,225,204,158,188,20,97,120,186,20,232,106,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
