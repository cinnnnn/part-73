This cut-rate 1964 western, starring Audie Murphy as Indian-hating cavalry officer Captain Jeff Stanton, assigned to an outpost near an Apache reservation, shows off WitneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s talent for creating dynamic dramas with highly-charged conflicts on a budget. Stanton is itching to take on the Indians but finds himself in an unexpected position when, after arguing with a Christian missionary (Linda Lawson) he mistakenly assumes is a captive of the Apaches, watches white settlers beat and torture Red Hawk (Michael Dante), the proud son of the tribal chief, and then whip up all the racist anger into a full-on war so they can get to the gold theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve discovered on the reservation.\n\nAudie Murphy, who plays Jeff Stanton, also in effect plays himself. He was a decorated war hero who won the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n\nApache Rifles (1964) Ã¢â‚¬â€ an action-filled story of an Indian-hating cavalry officer who has a change of heart when he meets a half-breed missionary Ã¢â‚¬â€ was making the rounds about the same time A Fistful Of Dollars was in production in Italy and Spain. The times they were a-changinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. And pictures like Apache Rifles would soon be almost extinct Ã¢â‚¬â€ short, tough (American) Westerns created by seasoned professionals with utmost efficiently.\n\nUtmost efficiency indeed. One of the real pleasures of Apache Rifles is watching all the pros at work. William Witney with his usual mastery of low-budget filmmaking, especially the action sequences. A tight script by TV Western specialist Charles B. Smith. \n\nAnd solid performances by a cast of veterans at this type of thing: Murphy, Michael Dante, L.Q. Jones, Linda Lawson, etc. \nThis is not to say that the picture succeeds only as a curio Ã¢â‚¬â€ Ã¢â‚¬Å“one of the last of a dying breedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or some sort of cinematic swan song for its participants. It works like so many similar films did before it. If you like medium-budget Westerns, or Audie Murphy pictures, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plenty to like here.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 866mb\nDuration.... 01:23:15\nCodec.... h264\nFrame Width..... 720\nFrame Height.... 390\nData Rate.... 1172kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 140kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 32KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f68ccdc305fde75e5228e24f1d4d4628e57c3df","amp;dn":"Apache+Rifles+1964+DvdRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f68ccdc305fde75e5228e24f1d4d4628e57c3df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,104,204,220,48,95,222,117,229,34,142,36,241,212,212,98,142,87,195,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
