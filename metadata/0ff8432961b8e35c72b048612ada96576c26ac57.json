The film is based on a story by Thomas Walsh and stars William Holden, Nancy Olson, Barry Fitzgerald, Lyle Bettger and Jan Sterling.Our overall rating for Union Station is: good.\n\nLos Angeles Union Station has been called the Ã¢â‚¬Å“last of the great railway stations built in the United States.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ With its signature clock tower, tiled arches, and cavernous lobby, the station is one of downtownÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most recognizable structures. It opened during the summer of 1939, crowding out a large portion of the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Chinatown neighborhood. It has also been a popular and versatile movie location, appearing in classic noirs such as Criss Cross, Cry Danger, and The Narrow Margin, as well as newer films ranging from Bugsy to Blade Runner. However itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s finest moment came in 1950, as the featured location the Paramount film noir Union Station. \n\nA sharp, brilliantly staged thriller about the kidnapping of a blind girl (Roberts), and the massive surveillance operation set up at Chicago's Union Station, the contact point established with the girl's father. Luck aiding, the kidnapper's plan starts to unravel almost immediately, with one associate trampled to death by cattle after being pursued into the stockyards; another spilling all he knows when cops threaten to throw him under a train; and a third (Sterling) left dying in the gutter when the hideout has to be abandoned. Undeterred, the dementedly vindictive kidnapper (Bettger) stashes the blind girl alone in a tunnel under the station strewn with naked high tension wires, then proceeds to try to collect the ransom... Agreeably ruthless on both sides of the law, the whole thing is considerably boosted by being shot on location (though not actual locations). Good performances down the line too, from Holden as the caring cop, Fitzgerald as the cynical one, and Olsen (secretary to the girl's father) as the bystander whose sharp eyes help crack the case. \n\nUnion Station is most commonly singled out for a scene in which Calhoun and Donnelly strong-arm the captured kidnapper, telling him they're going to throw him under a train and make it look like an accident. Although this situation illustrates an extreme case, before modern criminal rights legislation American police had much more latitude in their treatment of suspects. The issue has reappeared in today's fear-driven Homeland Security environment, in arguments that urge the abandonment of hard-won civil rights.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 2.90gb\nDuration.... 01:35:42\nCodec.... divx\nFrame Width..... 960\nFrame Height.... 720\nData Rate.... 5005kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23 F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 128kbps\n1 Channel mono\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48 KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ff8432961b8e35c72b048612ada96576c26ac57","amp;dn":"Union+Station+1950+BrRip+Avi+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ff8432961b8e35c72b048612ada96576c26ac57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,248,67,41,97,184,227,92,114,176,72,97,42,218,150,87,108,38,172,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
