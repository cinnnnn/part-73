Opener Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Last BattleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is indicative of the Manchester-based talent's present ambition, her voice multi-tracked into a dramatic, Morricone-style chorus, the sighing strings and vibrato guitar underlining that spag-western vibe and also nodding to the mariachi-flavoured psych of LoveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœAlone Again OrÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Ã¢â‚¬ËœHeartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ sounds like a less fragile Julia Holter, precious vocal harmonies and subtle synth zaps orbiting an almost new jack swing-style rhythm, but Elizabeth doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t settle into a predictable pattern: each song is given a unique treatment, whether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the pillowy cold wave string-pads cushioning Ã¢â‚¬ËœSimon Says DanceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ or the limpid piano minimalism of Ã¢â‚¬ËœDesireÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. She doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t overegg the pudding, paring the arrangements down to the essential, and rightly giving her glassily elegant vocals room to breathe - whether soloing intimately and unadorned or studio-spun into vast waves of harmony. Atmospheric, ambient-aware singer/songwriter fare has become an overcrowded genre in recent years, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth making room for this on your deck if you dig Holter, Colleen, Julianna Barwick, etc.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cf1b2b42ef8ddc4d4272b55f6c42a0f86c26e4a","amp;dn":"Nancy+Elizabeth+-+Dancing+%5B2013%5D%5BFLAC+%2F+WEB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cf1b2b42ef8ddc4d4272b55f6c42a0f86c26e4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,241,178,180,46,248,221,196,212,39,43,85,246,196,42,15,134,194,110,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
