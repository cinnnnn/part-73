Yet he inwardly rebels against the totalitarian world he lives in, which demands absolute obedience and controls him through the all-seeing telescreens and the watchful eye of Big Brother, symbolic head of the Party. In his longing for truth and liberty, Smith begins a secret love affair with a fellow-worker Julia, but soon discovers the true price of freedom is betrayal.\n\nContains an introduction by Thomas Pynchon, as well as an accompanying appendix and explanatory footnotes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5a82cd9b7b36d2f60b3dc09a1d98f9979d3e0e7","amp;dn":"Nineteen+Eighty-Four+-+George+Orwell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5a82cd9b7b36d2f60b3dc09a1d98f9979d3e0e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,168,44,217,183,179,109,47,96,179,220,9,161,217,143,153,121,211,224,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
