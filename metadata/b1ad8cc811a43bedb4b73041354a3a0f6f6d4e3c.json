Written by one of the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leading tea professionals, The Harney &amp; Sons Guide to Tea is an illuminating resource for tea drinkers interested in developing and refining their palate as well as their understanding of the complex agricultural, historical, and cultural significance of tea.\n\nDrawing on his singular experience, Michael Harney masterly explores the full range of teas, revealing how each tea is distinctive, with a taste that derives from a precise combination of cultivation and production techniques, and influenced by the geography as well as its history. These lively profiles of diverse tea varietiesÃ¢â‚¬â€from delicate white tea to aged black puerh teaÃ¢â‚¬â€include brewing instructions and vivid descriptions of the beverage scent, taste, and appearance; everything you need to become a connoisseur.\n\nTea has long been popular in the United States, but only recently have Americans treated this nuanced beverage with a deeper curiosity, more refined approach, and wider appetite. The Wall Street Journal reports that total U.S. tea sales are nearly four times what they were in 1990, and this growing population of discriminate consumers will celebrate the new vocabulary provided in The Harney &amp; Sons Guide to Tea.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1ad8cc811a43bedb4b73041354a3a0f6f6d4e3c","amp;dn":"The+Harney+%26amp%3B+Sons+Guide+to+Tea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1ad8cc811a43bedb4b73041354a3a0f6f6d4e3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,173,140,200,17,164,59,237,180,183,48,65,53,74,58,15,111,109,78,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
