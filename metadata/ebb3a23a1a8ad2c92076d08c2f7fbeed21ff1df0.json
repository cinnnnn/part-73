The franchise parodies numerous James Bond, Derek Flint, Jason King, and Matt Helm films, characters, and incorporates a myriad of other elements of popular culture as it follows a British spy's quest to bring his nemesis to justice.\n\nThe films poke fun at the outrageous plots, rampant sexual innuendo, and one-dimensional stock characters characteristically associated with 1960s spy films, as well as the clichÃƒÂ© of the ultra-suave male superspy. Contrary to the handsome, super-smooth leading men of the James Bond genre, Austin Powers is not conventionally attractive (he is especially known for his bad teeth), although female characters in the films seem to find him irresistible.\n\nThe general theme of the films is that the arch-villain Dr. Evil plots to extort large sums of money from governments or international bodies but is constantly thwarted by Powers, and (to a degree) his own inexperience with life and culture in the 1990s. In the first film, Austin and Dr. Evil are awakened after being cryogenically frozen for 30 years. Continuing to incorporate cultural elements of the 1960s and 1970s, the second and third films feature time travel as a plot device and deliberately overlook inconsistencies.\n\nInternational Man of Mystery 1997 BrRip XviD Xult &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118655/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118655/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Powers:_International_Man_of_Mystery&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Powers:_International_Man_of_Mystery&lt;/a&gt;\n\nA 1960s hipster secret agent is brought out of cryofreeze to oppose his greatest enemy in the 1990s, where his social attitudes are glaringly out of place.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 731mb\nDuration.... 01:29:35\nCodec....
