Although the band doesn't quite have Radiohead's talent for making the bombastic seem utterly personal, there are several moments of brilliance on the album -- particularly the singles &quot;Far,&quot; &quot;She Said&quot; and &quot;On and On&quot; -- suggesting that their appealingly neo-gothic sonic textures will develop into something distinctive on their second album.
