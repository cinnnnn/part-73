The film concentrates on the defense of the legations from the point of view of the foreign powers, and the title refers to the length of the defense by the colonial powers of the legations district of Peking.\n\nThe foreign embassies in Peking are held in a grip of terror as the Boxers set about killing Christians in an anti-Christian nationalistic fever. Inside the besieged compound, the British ambassador forges the beleaguered ambassadors into a defensive formation, with United States Marine Corps Major Matt Lewis heading a contingent of multinational soldiers and Marines defending it. Included in the group of high-level dignitaries is the sultry Russian Baroness Natalie Ivanoff, who begins a romantic liaison with Lewis. As the group conserves food and water while trying to save hungry children, it awaits reinforcements, but Empress Tzu Hsi is plotting with the Boxers to break the siege at the compound with the aid of Chinese troops.\n\n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/oaKKAAafd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/oaKKAAafd&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/oAkkEAaFd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/oAkkEAaFd&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/oaKKfAaFD&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/oaKKfAaFD&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/oAKkgaAFD&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/oAKkgaAFD&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/oaKKJaAFd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/oaKKJaAFd&lt;/a&gt;\n\n \n\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74eec42de694aaa2070880957411818f90422364","amp;dn":"55+Days+at+Peking++%28Action+1963%29++Charlton+Heston%2C+Ava+Gardner+%26","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74eec42de694aaa2070880957411818f90422364","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,238,196,45,230,148,170,162,7,8,128,149,116,17,129,143,144,66,35,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
