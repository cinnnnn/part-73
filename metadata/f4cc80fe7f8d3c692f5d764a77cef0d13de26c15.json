Since the release of their self-titled debut album in 1972, the band has sold over 24 million albums worldwide, including 7 million in the United States alone.[citation needed] The band's music videos, especially &quot;Burnin' for You&quot;, received heavy rotation on MTV when the music television network premiered in 1981, cementing the band's contribution to the development and success of the music video in modern pop culture. Today, BÃƒâ€“C's music continues to be played on AOR-friendly radio stations as well as in movies, television shows, and commercials, and even during sporting events.\n\nBlue Ãƒâ€“yster Cult's current lineup includes long-time members Donald &quot;Buck Dharma&quot; Roeser (lead guitar, vocals) and Eric Bloom (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboard), as well as Jules Radino (drums, percussion), Richie Castellano (keyboard, guitar, vocals), and Kasim Sulton (bass guitar).\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Secret Treaties is the third studio album by the American hard rock band Blue Ãƒâ€“yster Cult, released in 1974.\n\nSecret Treaties is regarded by many fans and critics alike as Blue Ãƒâ€“yster Cult's best album. The album spent 14 weeks in the US album charts, peaking at No. 53. It was declared gold by the RIAA in 1992.\n\nIn 1975, a poll of critics of the British magazine Melody Maker voted Secret Treaties as the &quot;Top Rock Album of All Time&quot;. In 2010, Rhapsody (online music service) called it one of the all-time best &quot;proto-metal&quot; albums.\n\nThe cover, with art by Ron Lesser, depicts the band standing beside and sitting on a German Me262 fighter aircraft; this scene is inspired by the song of the same name.\n\nMany songs from this album found their way into BOC playlists over the following years, including &quot;Career of Evil&quot;, &quot;Subhuman&quot;, &quot;Astronomy&quot; and &quot;Harvester of Eyes&quot;.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4cc80fe7f8d3c692f5d764a77cef0d13de26c15","amp;dn":"B.O.C.+-+Secret+Treaties+%5B1974%5D%5B2012%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D%5BRMSTD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4cc80fe7f8d3c692f5d764a77cef0d13de26c15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,204,128,254,127,141,60,105,47,93,118,74,119,206,240,209,61,226,108,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
