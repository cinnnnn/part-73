They decide to share it - and form a friendship that changes their lives . . . \n\nJenny can't wait to marry Dan. Then, after years of silence, she hears from the woman who could shatter her dreams. \n\nMaggie has put her broken heart behind her and is gearing up for the biggest event of her career - until she's forced to confront the past once more. \n\nAlison seems to have it all: married to her childhood sweetheart, with two gorgeous daughters. But as tensions mount, she is pushed to breaking point. \n\nDealing with friendship and families, relationships and careers, highs and lows, The Vintage Teacup Club is heart-warming storytelling at its very best.\n\n\nThis is a multi-tracker torrent.
