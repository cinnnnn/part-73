This is also an opportunity to lend a more modern approach to the adventure: it will be faster-paced and streamlined, with all unnecessary detail rooted out. The silly stuff is out too: the DJ is completley cut and Davros no longer makes the stupid decision of luring the Doctor into Nekros. No more Doctor tombstone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9ba046e11e4ede63a67231dcaf299c501e9481d","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+Revelation+of+the+Daleks+Fan+Edit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9ba046e11e4ede63a67231dcaf299c501e9481d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,186,4,110,17,228,237,230,58,103,35,29,202,242,153,197,1,233,72,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
