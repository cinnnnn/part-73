Pet/SFS etc functions however are still included. I also dropped gnome-mplayer back in again as without that firefox wouldn't load. \n\n Predominately intended as a ram only puppy version for online banking purposes. i.e. DON'T create a savefile. \n\n Boot from CD/DVD, activate firewall, activate network, then run the script in the home directory to automatically download Firefox. (Currently it both downloads latest Firefox and also creates a SFS of that, but its the downloaded firefox that should be run i.e. in something like ~/firefox28/opt/firefox). I snitched that code (in sfs-firefox.sh) but subsequently lost the link and the author didn't include their name in the script header. I'll attribute to them once I refind where I got the code from). BIG THX obviously goes out to 00micko for slacko_5.3.3t from which this was remastered.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e89ea444e814b5fe330d29622c4b064aaad55bb5","amp;dn":"Puppy_Linux_ThinSlacko_archive_24-Mar-2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e89ea444e814b5fe330d29622c4b064aaad55bb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,158,164,68,232,20,181,254,51,13,41,98,44,75,6,74,170,213,91,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
