RussiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s &quot;doomsday plane,&quot; a Tupolev Tu-214SR, has been spotted near Finland where NATO is deploying western soldiers. The plane, which accompanies President Putin on his travels, is an airborne command and control center. \n\nIn other news, several House Republicans are pushing for amnesty, which could allow Democrats to win elections in traditional red states such as Texas. \n\nJoseph Farah, journalist and editor-in-chief of World Net Daily, joins Alex in studio to discuss these topics and more. \n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
