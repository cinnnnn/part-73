Vincent Bramley describes in shocking detail the 12 hours of brutal man-to-man combat that it took before the Third Battalion Parachute Regiment were able to take the mountain from the Argentine forces. \n\nHe exposes the effects that the fear of dying and the reality of killing have on the ordinary soldier during the heat of battle. He tells how some men went AWOL, how others faced their fears and confronted the enemy, and how some went on a vicious killing spree. Bramley's underlying message is that war should be avoided at all costs. But, while wars continue to be fought around the globe, the grim reality of life on the frontline will be fully comprehended by all who read this book.\n\nGenre: History / Military","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dfbca99fa91c58d6defd0a4d1b22e6100dc6d34","amp;dn":"Forward+into+Hell+by+Vince+Bramley","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dfbca99fa91c58d6defd0a4d1b22e6100dc6d34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,251,202,153,250,145,197,141,109,239,208,164,209,178,46,97,0,220,109,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
