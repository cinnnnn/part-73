She will talk about so-called immigration reform and the influx of illegal aliens in the United States.\n\n--\n\nToday's show consists entirely of previously broadcast material. It appears that Alex took another &quot;Spring break&quot; day and had his crew put together this copy-and-paste presentation.\n\nThe Stefan Molyneux interview is from March 5, the Phyllis Schlafly interview is from the February 18 show.\n\nI'm uploading the Prison Planet &quot;members' edit&quot; for today, which has the regularly scheduled commercial breaks taken out.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
