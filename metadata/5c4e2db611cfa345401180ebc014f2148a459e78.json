The first edition was published in 1965. It is largely a revision of the American Standard Version of 1901, with reference made to various texts in the original languages. It is designed to &quot;amplify&quot; the text by using a system of punctuation and other typographical features to bring out all shades of meaning present in the original texts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c4e2db611cfa345401180ebc014f2148a459e78","amp;dn":"The+Amplified+Bible+%28AMP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c4e2db611cfa345401180ebc014f2148a459e78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,78,45,182,17,207,163,69,64,17,128,235,192,20,242,20,138,69,158,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
