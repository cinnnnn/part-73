It will also help you to make better bridges between learning in and out of school and create more effective approaches to home-based learning activities.\n\nThis course is part of the Foundations of Teaching for Learning program which is designed to assist people who are currently teaching but have had no formal teacher education improve their understanding of their role and work as a teacher.  This set of courses will enhance your knowledge and understanding about learning and teaching and what makes a teacher a professional.  \n\nPractical activities are provided to assist you in using what you have learned to improve your teaching practice.  While these are optional, it is strongly recommended that you undertake them if at all possible.\n\nOf particular importance is a guide to the development of a portfolio to help you organize and document your thinking about what you have learned. In addition, you may be able to use the portfolio to access other opportunities in the future.\n\nMore information about this course is available at https://coursera.org/course/teach4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b69a16f5dce6141f7ae7d5c4b14c83f4a85ef8b2","amp;dn":"%5BCoursera%5D+Foundations+of+Teaching+for+Learning+4+-+Curriculum","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b69a16f5dce6141f7ae7d5c4b14c83f4a85ef8b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,154,22,245,220,230,20,31,122,231,213,196,177,76,131,244,168,94,248,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
