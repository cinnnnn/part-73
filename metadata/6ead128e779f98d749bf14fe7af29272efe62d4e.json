I relate to the geeks better\nI could prolly speak better if I spit in Greek letters\nLike kappa, iota, nu, epsilon, tau\nIota, kappa, sigma, homie now you break it down (down, down)\nAnd I'm about to see the dollars\n'Cause like a Jewish bakery, I'm makin' people holla \nAnd a lot of people go to shows \nIf they had a comic of my concert, every fan would be blowin' Os\nLittle white circles in the voice bubble \n'Cause they diggin' it like a little kid with a toy shovel \nSo gather all ya infantry into the trench, quick\n'Cause like Lady Liberty, Kinetics was a French gift\nAnd Timmy Talent is a hazardous male\nNow that I have him backin' me, rappers will naturally fail \nNow that I found the hidden treasure, man I have to prevail \nLike the casket of Mary Magdalene attached to the Grail\nCall me the savior of the music, New York City is my Nazareth \nThe Statue of Liberty, lyrically I'm Emma Lazarus\nSo give me all your tired, and give me all your poor \nAnd I'ma give you back a fire that they don't make anymore \nAnd for all the huddled masses that are washin' up on shore \nI'ma lift the microphone and hold open the doorÃ¢â‚¬Â¦yo one love\n\n[Chorus]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ead128e779f98d749bf14fe7af29272efe62d4e","amp;dn":"Kinetics+%26amp%3B+One+Love+-+The+New+Colossus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ead128e779f98d749bf14fe7af29272efe62d4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,173,18,142,119,159,152,215,73,191,20,254,122,242,146,114,239,230,45,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
