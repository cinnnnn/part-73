The duo is known for its Southern rock influences. Steve Huey of Allmusic wrote that the duo evokes the sound and spirit of Southern rockers like Lynyrd Skynyrd, the Marshall Tucker Band, and Charlie Daniels, painting themselves as rowdy redneck rebels who still hold small-town values.\n\nYou Do Your Thing, is their fourth album and has been certified platinum by the RIAA (wikipedia)\n\n- - -\n\nMontgomery Gentry - You Do Your Thing 2004\n(Sony Music 2011)\n\n 1.
