Substantial historical liberties are taken.\n\nThe film stars von Sternberg's lover Marlene Dietrich as Catherine, supported by John Davis Lodge, Sam Jaffe, Louise Dresser, and C. Aubrey Smith. Dietrich's daughter Maria Riva plays Catherine as a child.\n\n    CAST:-\n    Marlene Dietrich as Princess Sophie Friederike Auguste von Anhalt-Zerbst-Dornburg, later Empress Catherine II\n    John Davis Lodge as Count Alexey Razumovsky\n    Sam Jaffe as Grand Duke Peter, later Emperor Peter III\n    Louise Dresser as Empress Elizaveta Petrovna\n    C.

She is brought to Russia by Count Alexei (Lodge) at the behest of Empress Elizabeth (Dresser) to marry her nephew, Grand Duke Peter (played as a half-wit by Jaffe in his film debut). The overbearing Elizabeth renames her Catherine and reinforces the demand the new bride issue an heir to the throne.\n\nUnhappy in her marriage, Catherine finds solace with the womanizing Alexei, first and foremost a paramour of the much-older Elizabeth. Rebuffed at this discovery, she takes lovers among the Russian Army to court its favor. When the old Empress dies seventeen years into their marriage, Peter ascends to the Russian throne and takes steps against his wife. \n\nSoon Catherine plots and exercises a coup, beginning a reign as Empress that will leave her known to history as Catherine the Great.\n\nThe film is notable for its attentive lighting and the expressionist art design von Sternberg creates for the Russian palace. In film critic Robin Wood's words:\n a hyperrealist atmosphere of nightmare with its gargoyles, its grotesque figures twisted into agonized contortions, its enormous doors that require a half-dozen women to close or open, its dark spaces and ominous shadows created by the flickerings of innumerable candles, its skeleton presiding over the royal wedding banquet table.\n\nThe Scarlet Empress was one of the last mainstream Hollywood motion pictures to be released before the Hays Code was strictly enforced, but was &quot;condemned&quot; by the Catholic Legion of Decency as &quot;morally objectionable&quot;.\n\nThe Scarlet Empress was described as one of Marlene Dietrich's most frank and suggestive films, which portrays Russia's future queen Catherine the Great as an oversexed, sexually-depraved dominatrix. The historic film is filled with erotic images and motifs. It also contains depictions of torture.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-2\nVideo Bitrate: 4999 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec:  AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 77 mins\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 77 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1993b0d74510392ac1ad9567906bb3d3bf3035f","amp;dn":"The+Scarlet+Empress+%281934%29+DVD9+-+Marlene+Dietrich+Collection+%5BD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1993b0d74510392ac1ad9567906bb3d3bf3035f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,153,59,13,116,81,3,146,172,26,217,86,121,6,187,61,59,243,3,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
