RELEASE.DATE .. PROTECTION .......: Steam\n               1 :.......... DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE ........: Adventure, Indie\n                                                            RPG, Strategy \n\n     \n\n   MAN MEETS MAGIC &amp; MACHINE. In 2012, magic returned to our world, awakening\n   powerful creatures of myth and legend. Among them was the Great Dragon\n   Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany\n   unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It\n   took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when\n   they finally did, the event became known as the Dragonfall. \n\n   It's 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in\n   technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls\n   walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinge's\n   reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable\n   anarchy known as the Flux State controls the city of Berlin. It's a place\n   where power is ephemeral, almost anything goes, and the right connections can\n   be the difference between success and starvation. For you and your team of\n   battle-scarred shadowrunners, there's no better place to earn a quick payday. \n\n   Now, a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and\n   devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of\n   a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall. Rumors that\n   the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive, waiting for the right\n   moment to return \n\n   Shadowrun: Dragonfall Features\n   * Experience a New Full-Length Campaign: Return to the Tech meets Magic\n   future of Shadowrun in an all-new 12+ hour campaign.
