While the victorious villain recedes into the shadows, a new threat known as The Lawgiver targets every cop in the city. The Spider's enemies are closing in... but it's Commissioner Kirkpatrick and the entire police force that may suffer in the most shocking ending of any comic this year!\n\n------\n\nWell this one was only 3 weeks late! Dynamite's on-schedule record in 2013 is the green apple shits! I'm also not sure how much I'd categorize a pulp hero as &quot;Sci-Fi&quot; and &quot;Fantasy&quot;, but whatever. At least it came out!\n\nHey remember at the end of Prophecy, when that thing happened to Red Sonja? And how it was going to carry over into her monthly title? Uh yeah, they're so far behind, that still hasn't happened. And now they're rebooting her book or something. Fucking Dynamite. Rumor has it they're just going to give up and merge with Dark Horse, anyway...  --STFmaryville","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bd2ae13c79598f64845129a7a673ac56cdedbc3","amp;dn":"THE+SPIDER+011+%282013%29+%28Dynamite%29+%28Digital%29+%28jk-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bd2ae13c79598f64845129a7a673ac56cdedbc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,210,174,19,199,149,152,246,72,69,18,154,122,103,58,197,108,222,219,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
