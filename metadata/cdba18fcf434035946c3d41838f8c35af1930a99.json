Power light on, sometimes sound but no picture.\n\n2 bad capacitors on the power supply board was usually the problem and easily fixed for a few dollars.\n\nExcept no one would ever tell you exactly which caps were bad......\n\n\nThis is the service manual with detailed instructions for trouble shooting and diagnosing (and fixing) issues with these TV's.\n\nIt is listed as a Phillips product, while the Dell TV's were made with Samsung silk screened on the circuit boards. Phillips designed and manufactured these boards for Samsung...who manufactured them for Dell.\n\nI am sure this will help some of you out there!\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdba18fcf434035946c3d41838f8c35af1930a99","amp;dn":"Dell+42+and+50+inch+Plasma+Service+Manual","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdba18fcf434035946c3d41838f8c35af1930a99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,186,24,252,244,52,3,89,70,195,212,24,56,248,195,90,241,147,10,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
