Movie is grainy and lags a bit with occasional blackouts of the screen that last a few seconds, but it's decent and watchable.\nFor some reason, this movie is not out on DVD, which is why I've uploaded it here.\nNOTE: I haven't watched this recorded copy the whole way through; only skipped through a few scenes to see how it had turned out, so although I can't record another copy because it was taken off Netflix on May 1, 2014, report problems to me anyway, just so I can warn people in this description.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f70c3636c13f0bb3f274bd45623ec9cef1e0b44","amp;dn":"The+Ballad+of+Lucy+Whipple+%282001%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f70c3636c13f0bb3f274bd45623ec9cef1e0b44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,112,195,99,108,19,240,187,63,39,75,212,86,35,236,156,239,30,11,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
