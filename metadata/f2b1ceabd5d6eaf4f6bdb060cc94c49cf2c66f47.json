Because it is a book of facts, you don't read it\nfrom beginning to end, but rather you jump in wherever it strikes your\nfancy. There are over three hundred separate items, each a complete\nstory in itself.\n\nAs a rule, much of the information found in one section of the book\nwill usually also be applicable to the others as well. After all, although\naircraft carriers are inseparably associated with the Pacific war, they\nalso performed yeoman service in the Atlantic and Mediterranean,\nwhile the problems of troop transport transcended theater.\n\nAfter reading this book, you'll never look at World War II\nthe same way again. We have not changed the story of that conflict; we are\nproviding information about it that is not generally known. We often\nlook at the same subject from several different angles, giving you a\nbetter appreciation of, for example, how a blitzkrieg was conducted,\nwhat it took to supply partisans, and why the U.S. Army had more\nships than the U.S. Navy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2b1ceabd5d6eaf4f6bdb060cc94c49cf2c66f47","amp;dn":"Dirty+Little+Secrets+of+WWII","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2b1ceabd5d6eaf4f6bdb060cc94c49cf2c66f47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,177,206,171,213,214,234,244,246,189,176,96,204,148,196,156,242,198,111,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
