No prior knowledge of C++ is assumed. The course is based on the excellent textbook Accelerated C++ by Andrew Koenig and Barbara E. Moo. Like the textbook, the course quickly dives into problem solving and making use of the C++ standard library, including strings, vectors, and lists. The emphasis is on teaching you the parts of C++ that you will most likely need in your day-to-day programming. This course is Part 1 of a planned two-part sequence. Part 1 covers the first seven chapters of Accelerated C++, in particular, Chapters 0 through 6. The course consists of six videos of 50-60 minutes each.\n\nPart 2 of the course, forthcoming, will cover the second half of Accelerated C++, including how to write your own classes and generic functions (unknown release date).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74c4d50e1bd73b5cfe386685708653e0e02e07e8","amp;dn":"Udemy+-+C%2B%2B%2C+Short+and+Sweet+%28Pt+1%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74c4d50e1bd73b5cfe386685708653e0e02e07e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,196,213,14,27,215,59,92,254,56,102,133,112,134,83,224,224,46,7,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
