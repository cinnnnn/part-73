It ended in February/March 2014.\n\nThis course views climate change from a variety of perspectives at the intersection of the natural sciences, technology, and the social sciences and humanities.\n \nSpecific topics included are:\n\n- the scientific basis for human-induced climate change, including uncertainties and controversies, the historical context for identifying the climate problem, links to other issues such as air pollution, and the evidence for extreme as well as irreversible climate changes;\n- communication and social responses to the scientific evidence, including the role of science in the media;\n- assessment of climate impacts and adaptive management; and\n- mitigation of emissions, including the design of national policy instruments, the roles of market failures such as in technological innovation, and the role of institutions in managing international collective action. \n\nMore information about this course is available at https://coursera.org/course/4dimensions\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8af3d99a558522a214bbd1cec1e4745e1d1dc54","amp;dn":"%5BCoursera%5D+Climate+Change+in+Four+Dimensions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8af3d99a558522a214bbd1cec1e4745e1d1dc54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,175,61,153,165,88,82,42,33,75,189,28,236,30,71,69,225,209,220,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
