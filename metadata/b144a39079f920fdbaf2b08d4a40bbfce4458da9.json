One day while on a drive, Philipp (Benno FÃƒÂ¼rmann) becomes involved in a fight with his fiancÃƒÂ©e, Katja (Antje Westermann). While he is distracted, he runs into a boy. Instead of stopping, he continues home. Although the couple momentarily salvages their rocky relationship, the boy dies. Laura (Nina Hoss), the victim's mother, attempts to track down the man responsible for her son's death. Eventually she and Philipp meet, but they are unaware of their link. They begin a relationship that lasts until the truth is revealed. Wolfsburg was screened at the Berlin Film Festival. \n\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English / French","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b144a39079f920fdbaf2b08d4a40bbfce4458da9","amp;dn":"Wolfsburg+2003+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b144a39079f920fdbaf2b08d4a40bbfce4458da9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,68,163,144,121,249,32,253,186,242,176,141,74,64,187,252,228,69,141,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
