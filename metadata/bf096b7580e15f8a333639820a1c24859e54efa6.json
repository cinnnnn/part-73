Ken discovers ultra fine gold stashed deep in the ground at Moose Creek and sinks tens of thousands of dollars into digging it out. New miner Cam bets on an old-timer streak at his mine on 10 Mile Creek. Just as it starts to pay big, a forest fire threatens to destroy the moneymaker mine and his familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s livelihood. KarlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gamble on the dredge edge is iced when veteran operator Darwin no shows, forcing Karl to take on dangerous ground alone and decide if DarwinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lifelong partying is more trouble than his experience is worth.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf096b7580e15f8a333639820a1c24859e54efa6","amp;dn":"YUKON_GOLD_2x02_In_For_A_Penny_In_For_A_Pound.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf096b7580e15f8a333639820a1c24859e54efa6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,9,107,117,128,225,95,138,51,54,57,130,10,28,36,133,158,84,239,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
