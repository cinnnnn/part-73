DON'T BE A DOUCHE, SHARE WITH EVERYONE ELSE.\n\nNow, for what I hope is the first time on The Pirate Bay, both of JÃƒÂ¶rg Buttgereit's controversial NEKRomantik films, in their completely uncut DVDRip format, with HARDCODED English subtitles.\n\nNEKRomantik (71:16/1:11:16), directed by Buttgereit, follows a street sweeper who cleans up after grisly accidents brings home a full corpse for him and his wife to enjoy sexually, but is dismayed to see that his wife prefers the corpse over him.\n\nNEKRomantik 2 (102:55/1:42:55), still directed by Buttgereit, sees a female nurse desperately trying to hide her feelings of necrophilia from her new boyfriend, but still has pieces of the corpse of the first film's hero in her possession.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23ecdee19070142fac68d97020c17948df28b920","amp;dn":"The+NEKRomantik+series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23ecdee19070142fac68d97020c17948df28b920","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,236,222,225,144,112,20,47,172,104,217,112,32,193,121,72,223,40,185,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
