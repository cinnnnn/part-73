Captain Whip Whitaker is in command of Jackson-Ridgefield 88 with his young, formal co-pilot and his first officer Ken Evans, who is the polar opposite of Whip in every way. The flight is soon encountering violent turbulence more than expected as deep into a storm. It is not a problem for Whip that directs the plane to clear, to the relief of the 96 passengers and 6 crew members on board, though it does so in a very unconventional and shocking, is right when things go wrong really. Abruptly, pilots are faced with a series of inexplicable mechanical failure, causing the plane to move like a roller coaster. According to these complications are multiplied, causing the plane to spiral and apparently falls outside the control of the pilots, Whip decides the only way to keep up is to make an acrobatic maneuver with the plane of 50 tons, so that it can slide no motors until I get right the plane and land. After a few minutes, without having arrived at the airport, flying to a few feet above the ground, Whip sees a nearby clearing next to a church where you can try to land. At 140 miles per hour, invests the plane and get to land. The impact is brutal, but Whip, amazing and ingeniously, get landing safely enough to save all the passengers except six.\n\nFor his miraculous landing, media Whip declare a hero. But there are a number of unresolved questions. The reason for the accident is not entirely clear to their superiors and, in particular, for the NTSB (National Board Transportation Safety). Although Whip is sure not to be him at the controls, the plane had crashed and all the passengers had died.\n\nProduction notes:\nThe film marks the return to real action for the director Robert Zemeckis.\n\n***************************************************************************************\nNota: Compartir es un placer, no lo estropees y conparte, si tienes algun problema busca por el google, hay muchas soluciones, saludos y gracias a tod@s.\n=======================================================================================\nNote: Share is a pleasure, and conparte not spoil it if you have a problem looking for google, there are many solutions, greetings and thanks to all @ s.\n***************************************************************************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e7734d2bb6fb4c19bdf142f6e3f6e3a18f6fa01","amp;dn":"Flight+%282012%29+%5BMICROHD+1080p%5D+%5BDUAL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e7734d2bb6fb4c19bdf142f6e3f6e3a18f6fa01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,119,52,210,187,111,180,193,155,223,20,47,110,63,110,58,24,246,250,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
