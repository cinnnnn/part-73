They've taken elements from noise, power electronics, drone, and black metal to come up with a truly unique sound reflecting the sprawling urban decay surrounding them in Chicago. After nearly two dozen releases, they've found themselves in the world of Territories. For this release, Locrian has pulled out all the stops and fleshed out the band with the help of Mark Solotroff (Bloodyminded, Anatomy of Habit) on vocals and synthesizers, Blake Judd (Nachtmystium) on guitar, Bruce Lamont (Yakuza) on saxophone and vocals, and Andrew Scherer (Velnias) on drums. The results of this massive collaborative effort are apparent from the moment the album starts. The textures run darker and deeper; the vocals-sometimes three layers deep-seem to be conjured from the decrepit muck of a failed civilization; the feedback takes on a more pronounced presence; and the big band allows for full-on black metal assaults that burst out of the tortured drones Locrian have come to be known for. Truly a case of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts, Territories may well be the most fully realized form of Locrian's dystopic vision.\n\n500 copies, full-colour pro sleeve and insert. Collab with Basses Frequencies (Fr), Bloodlust! (USA) and Small Doses (USA).\n\nBloodLust! and Small Doses are pleased to announce their co-release of &quot;Territories,&quot; the second studio full-length from Locrian. The album was recorded in January 2009, at Phantom Manor Studios in Chicago, IL, and it features a group of collaborators including Blake Judd (Nachtmystium, Twilight), Bruce Lamont (Yakuza), Andrew Scherer (Velnias), and Mark Solotroff (Anatomy of Habit, BLOODYMINDED).

The textures run darker and deeper; the vocals -- sometimes three layers deep -- seem to be conjured from the decrepit muck of a failed civilization; the feedback takes on a more pronounced presence; and the augmented line-up allows for full-on black metal assaults that burst out of the tortured drones that Locrian have come to be known for. Truly a case of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts, &quot;Territories&quot; may well be the most fully realized form of LocrianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dystopian vision. As with their previous album, &quot;Drenched Lands&quot; (2009, At War With False Noise and Small Doses - CD; BloodLust! - LP), &quot;Territories&quot; was skillfully mastered by Jason Ward at Chicago Mastering Service, and the sound could not be more monumental. The limited edition LP version of &quot;Territories,&quot; released in March 2010, garnered extremely strong critical attention (see selected reviews below) and we expect to reach even more ears and eyes with this new, handsome six-panel digipak compact disc edition.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77c26072cf5bbf1064fe39e4022e8130c895e5c3","amp;dn":"Locrian+-+Territories+%282010%29+%5BV0%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77c26072cf5bbf1064fe39e4022e8130c895e5c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,194,96,114,207,91,191,16,100,254,57,228,2,46,129,48,200,149,229,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
