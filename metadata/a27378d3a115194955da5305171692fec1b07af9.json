He teaches you how to control the fight from the first instant, disrupting your opponent's rhythm and keeping him so off-balance that he'll have no time to react. Simonet also provides vital instruction on the supported elbow frame, an all-purpose defense that allows you to take even the strongest of blows without injury.
