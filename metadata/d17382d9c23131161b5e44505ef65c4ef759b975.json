A lifelong nonbeliever, he found himself on a bizarre adventure, involving a disgraced pastor, a mysterious self-help guru, and a gaggle of brain scientists. Eventually, Harris realized that the source of his problems was the very thing he always thought was his greatest asset: the incessant, insatiable voice in his head, which had both propelled him through the ranks of a hyper-competitive business and also led him to make the profoundly stupid decisions that provoked his on-air freak-out.\n\nWe all have a voice in our head. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what has us losing our temper unnecessarily, checking our email compulsively, eating when weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not hungry, and fixating on the past and the future at the expense of the present. Most of us would assume weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re stuck with this voice Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing we can do to rein it in Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but Harris stumbled upon an effective way to do just that. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a far cry from the miracle cures peddled by the self-help swamis he met; instead, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s something he always assumed to be either impossible or useless: meditation. After learning about research that suggests meditation can do everything from lower your blood pressure to essentially rewire your brain, Harris took a deep dive into the underreported world of CEOs, scientists, and even marines who are now using it for increased calm, focus, and happiness.\n\n10% Happier takes readers on a ride from the outer reaches of neuroscience to the inner sanctum of network news to the bizarre fringes of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spiritual scene, and leaves them with a takeaway that could actually change their lives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d17382d9c23131161b5e44505ef65c4ef759b975","amp;dn":"10%25+Happier_+How+I+Tamed+the+Vo+-+Dan+Harris.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d17382d9c23131161b5e44505ef65c4ef759b975","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,115,130,217,194,49,49,22,27,94,68,80,94,246,92,78,247,89,185,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
