Trey subsequently quoted I Love You (a.k.a. the theme to Barney &amp; Friends) before Harpua resumed. Poster was swallowed up into the earth by the Vibration of Death. &quot;The Vibration of Death is gone&quot; replaced the usual &quot;The storm is gone.&quot; Prior to the Vibration of Life, Wilson was teased and quoted. A Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon tease (the heartbeats from Speak to Me) was pumped through the P.A. at the beginning of the second set. The second set &quot;musical costume&quot; was The Beatles' The Beatles (also known as The White Album) and was selected via fan vote. All of the White Album songs, other than Piggies, were Phish debuts, although Ob La Di, Ob La Da had been jammed or teased on many occasions.

HYHU was teased prior to Why Don't We Do It in the Road. Birthday wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sung; Page and Mike noodled a bit while Fishman presented a birthday cake to Brad Sands, who accepted it while wearing a Fishman dress. Helter Skelter ended with the band singing &quot;I've got blisters on my fingers&quot; a cappella to the tune of Back In My Hometown. Honey Pie's lyrics were changed to reference &quot;Cactus.&quot; Cry Baby Cry ended with Fishman on vacuum with Revolution 9 segueing out of the vacuum solo. The background tape playing along with Revolution 9 was MikeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s composition He Ent to the Bog from PhishÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s White Tape.
