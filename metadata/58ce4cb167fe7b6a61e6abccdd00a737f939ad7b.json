When the job goes awry, the entire family is set on a collision course with tragedy. Andy (Hoffman) is an overextended broker in desperate need of some cash. His brother, Hank (Hawke), isn't much better off, so when Andy hatches a plan to rob their parent's modest jewelry store, it seems like a foolproof way to make a quick buck. But Andy's trophy wife, Gina (Tomei), is secretly sleeping with libidinous younger brother Hank, and when the robbery proves a complete disaster it isn't long before loyalties start to shift. Now Andy and Hank's father, Charles (Finney), is determined to make the unidentified robbers pay for their crime. What's a father to do when he discovers that the ones he loves have become his worst enemies?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58ce4cb167fe7b6a61e6abccdd00a737f939ad7b","amp;dn":"Before+The+Devil+Knows+You+re+Dead+2007+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58ce4cb167fe7b6a61e6abccdd00a737f939ad7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,206,76,177,103,254,123,106,97,230,171,204,221,0,167,55,249,57,173,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
