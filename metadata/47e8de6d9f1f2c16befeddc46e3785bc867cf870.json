The film stars Mickey Spillane, Shirley Eaton, Scott Peters, Guy Kingsley Poynter and James Dyrenforth.Our overall rating for The Girl Hunters is: good.\n\nA slick and entertaining adventure meller, The Girl Hunters also debuts author Mickey Spillane portraying his rough Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ tumble hero Mike Hammer for the first time on the screen. He turns in a credible job.Plot finds the private eye in the gutter from seven years of boozing and fretting because he believes that he sent his secretary and best gal to her doom when he gave her an assignment to do. It develops, however, that she may still be alive and Hammer straightens out and goes in search of her Ã¢â‚¬Ëœjust like the old daysÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, as one of the characters comments.\n\nMickey Spillane is Mike Hammer.Spillane himself stars as private detective Mike Hammer, one of the few occasions in film history in which an author of a popular literary hero has portrayed his own character. \n\nNovelist Mickey Spillane portrays his own creation, Mike Hammer, in The Girl Hunters. Hammer has spent seven years in an alcoholic funk after the supposed death of his secretary, Velda. He is brought back to the land of the living by his old friendly enemy, police lieutenant Pat Chambers (Scott Peters), who wants Hammer to extract some information out of a dying federal agent. \n\nThis puts Mike on the trail of a subversive communist organization, the key to which seems to be sexy Laura Knapp (Shirley Eaton), the widow of a murdered senator. When Hammer determines that following this espionage trail may lead to relocating Velda, who might not be dead after all, he pursues matters with his usual fascistic tendency to pummel first and ask questions later. The Girl Hunters is the film in which Mike Hammer incapacitates an opponent by literally nailing the latter's hands to the floor. But that's kid stuff compared to the fate in store for the treacherous Laura Knapp. The Girl Hunters was filmed in its entirety in England.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 637mb\nDuration.... 01:37:37\nCodec....
