Close friend and future colleague Blur's Alex James duly agreed and recruited Stephen Duffy, Elastica's Justin Welch, and longtime friend Charlie Bloor to record a song of the same name. In spite of rumors to the contrary, James' bandmate, Damon Albarn, approved of the collaboration and the release of Hanging Around as a single resulted in a U.K. Top 20 chart position, proving to be one of the catchiest songs of the summer. The quartet went back to respective former band duties, as talk of a second single never materialized.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eccf8bccc9002748b1d15c69b9e62b9a7133bd10","amp;dn":"Me+Me+Me+-+Hanging+Around+%5B1996%5D+%28Single%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eccf8bccc9002748b1d15c69b9e62b9a7133bd10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,207,139,204,201,0,39,72,177,209,92,105,185,230,43,154,113,51,189,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
