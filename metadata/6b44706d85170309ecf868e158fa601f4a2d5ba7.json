If you are a person with the stomach to deal with your failures - this is likely to amuse you nicely. Otherwise you can call it a clever way to go about bullshit and you`d hate it you have troubles looking in the mirror.\n\nYou getting sick of all the fluffy movies telling you paradise is around the corner, and saviors are their way to rescue us from our every trouble. You know - Just vote for us, give us your moneys, pray out our temples - just do that and we'll give you wings, you don't have to lift a finger.\n\nINTRO : A few non spoiler quotes:\n\n&quot;The increasing number of Ã¢â‚¬Å“enlighteningÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ materials floating about is seriously stinking lately, even if conspiracy is not in your vocabulary.

So given the opportunity to use instruments to influence individual or a multitude of psychesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to gain results of preference how many people would turn away from that opportunity? A step further, how many people would pay good moneys at a chance to avoid personal responsibility? Now if such means existed wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t concealment be among their primary purposes?
