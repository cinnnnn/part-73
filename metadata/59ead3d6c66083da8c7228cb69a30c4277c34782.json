At that time he began not only playing in public again but recording for Highnote and Savant, too. That said, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been known to take long breaks: six years off between 1995 and 2001, and, after recording regularly between then and 2006, another half decade. A Philadelphia Story marks his return. The time off hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t blunted Papa John's chops, however. Despite the fact that he lives in Arizona these days, DeFrancescoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music is pure, gritty Philly soul-jazz. Here heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s joined by his other son, the guitar-slinging John Jr., and drummer Glenn Ferracone. The program is a smoking collection of soul, funk, jazz, and standards with a pair of originals tossed in. The set kicks off with a finger-popping reading of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Papa Was a Rolling Stone.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ John Jr.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s razor-sharp funk creates the groove while Papa comps and adds smoldering undertones to FerraconeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stellar breaks (which are ever-present on the album). Son Joey makes one of two guest appearances with a boppish trumpet solo to close it out. A spine-slipping gutbucket version of CreamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Strange BrewÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ follows. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in-the-pocket, bluesed-out soul-jazz, with stinging though economical guitar fills. PapaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s solo is strong, and full of twists and turns. Joey returns on a lovely, elegant, and understated reading of Ã¢â‚¬Å“By the Time I Get to Phoenix,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the most lyrical thing here. Lou Donaldson's hard bopping Ã¢â‚¬Å“The ThangÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ gets fine treatment, with a twinned guitar/B-3 head; itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brief, yet features rhythmically taut arpeggios by John Jr. and a ripping solo by Papa. The Isley Brothers' Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Your ThingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ really shows off PapaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own deep soul-jazz chops; he turns this one inside out and follows it with a complete harmonic re-visioning of Ã¢â‚¬Å“You Are My Sunshine.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ John Jr. does his best Wes Montgomery as he and Papa trade fours on the tune. Saxophonist Joe Fortunato guests on Oscar Pettiford's Ã¢â‚¬Å“Blues in the Closet,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a straight-up hard bop blues. The closing title track moves ever deeper into that terrain. PapaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s organ solo shines brightly in the tuneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s moody darkness and is a real highlight on the set. Any way you cut it, A Philadelphia Story is smoking B-3 jazz with kick, swagger, and funky butt grooves; it marks the welcome return of a master jazzman.
