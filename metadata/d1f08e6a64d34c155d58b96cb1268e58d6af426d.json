In this intensely thoughtful memoir, Spencer Mitchell probes the motivations that impelled her, a single, Jewish woman, to document the turmoil roiling the Arab world in the 1980s and 1990s, as well as how her experiences as a photojournalist &quot;compelled [me] to set aside [my] cameras and reexamine the way images are created, scenes are framed, and how 'real life' is packaged for specific news stories.&quot;\nIn Danger Pay, Spencer Mitchell takes us on a harrowing journey to PLO military training camps for Palestinian children and to refugee camps in the Gaza Strip before, during, and after the first intifada. Through her eyes, we experience the media frenzy surrounding the 1985 hijackings of TWA Flight #847 and the Italian cruise liner Achille Lauro. We meet Middle Eastern leaders, in particular Yasser Arafat and King Hussein of Jordan, with whom Spencer Mitchell developed close working relationships. And we witness Spencer Mitchell's growing conviction that the Western media's portrayal of conflicts in the Middle East actually helps to fuel those conflictsÃ¢â‚¬â€a conviction that eventually, as she says, &quot;shattered my career.&quot;\nAlthough the events that Spencer Mitchell records took place a generation ago, their repercussions reverberate in the conflicts going on in the Middle East today. Likewise, her concern about &quot;the triumph of image over reality&quot; takes on greater urgency as our knowledge of the world becomes ever more filtered by virtual media.\n===================================================================================\nReviews\n&quot;A deeply felt and moving account from an enterprising and conscientious news photographer who worked the always-busy beat of the Middle East in the last, great days of film photography.&quot; Rod Nordland, Chief Foreign Correspondent, Newsweek\n\n&quot;Reading Danger Pay was a harrowing experience. Being a photojournalist on the front lines in the Middle East is no easy assignment. Writing about it with such vivid detail and thoughtful analysis is an equally impressive feat. This is a truly moving memoir in every way.&quot; Douglas Brinkley, Rice University, author of The Great Deluge: Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans, and the Mississippi Gulf Coast\n===================================================================================\nMost Helpful Customer Reviews\nRevelation\nBy Brian Mitchell on February 5, 2009\nFormat: Hardcover Verified Purchase\nAn excellent and revealing memoir about how one courageous freelance female photojournalist traveled the Middle East trouble spots, photographed world leaders as well as terrorists and eventually surrendered photojournalism in disillusion. It is informative background reading to understanding the Arab-Israeli conflict.\n\nFascinated by Danger Pay\nBy Robin on May 6, 2009\nFormat: Hardcover\nBefore reading Danger Pay, I thumbed through the photographs. Some of the images look just like the ones seen in current media. Danger Pay is so unfortunately relevant today. Spencer Mitchell's work provides a unique foundation for those interested in the study of Middle Eastern politics by sharing her experiences as an American photojournalist. Personally, I find following the political scene in that region to be very overwhelming and having a resource like Danger Pay has been a springboard to seek further information in other related areas. Knowing that Spencer Mitchell was not much older than I am now when she was carving out her career makes this quite an enjoyable and exciting read. Imagining myself armed with a camera and a gas mask, minus all forms of modern technology, meeting with foreign world leaders in hot zones for a decade is wild. But she lived this unique life. Her growth as a person as well as a photojournalist is remarkable. Her willingness to discuss media manipulation of image is honorable and should not be overlooked. It should encourage all to seek truth above the comfort of media soundbytes. My focus turns to other journalists and photojournalists to seek out and encourage their real life accounts of their work abroad. Spencer Mitchell's sister, Ellen Spencer Susman, did a fantastic job of following through with her request of finishing Danger Pay after Spencer Mitchell passed away in 2004. Completing a book is a challenge, but doing so for a loved one in order to preserve the integrity of their memoir and legacy is both an honor and a challenge - a true labor of love.\n\nI loved this book\nBy M. W. MILLER on February 10, 2009\nFormat: Hardcover\nNothing rings more true of a memoir than the engaging voice of its author. This book documents the experiences of Spencer Mitchell who worked as as a photojournalist in the Middle East and subsequently died of breast cancer, leaving this manuscript behind. She writes compelling accounts of military training camps where women and children were learning terrorist tactics, of intimate meetings with world leaders, of the breathtaking landscape. Her photographs are stunning. I was especially moved by her story of little girls in a battered school room in Gaza--we are still reading about children like these today in a war-torn country. Spencer Mitchell's sister did a wonderful job editing this book. So glad I read it.\n\nDanger Pay\nBy Andrea White on December 9, 2008\nFormat: Hardcover\nMitchell's story weaves together a partial history, a travelogue,a memoir and reflections on the art of photography. While I was intrigued by the author's adventures, I was just as interested in her motivation for always putting herself in zones requiring danger pay. I think anyone reading this book would like to know more about her and will be saddened by her tragic death a few years ago of breast cancer. The photographs are stunning, but this author is the rare person who is a master of two arts for she is also a beautiful prose stylist. Well-done.\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1f08e6a64d34c155d58b96cb1268e58d6af426d","amp;dn":"Carol+Spencer+Mitchell+-+Danger+Pay+%5B2008%5D%5BA%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1f08e6a64d34c155d58b96cb1268e58d6af426d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,240,142,106,100,211,76,21,93,88,185,108,177,38,142,88,214,175,66,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
