Osho helps the reader to face the reality of his own death without fear, and thereby living life to the optimum. Originating in Poland around 1750, Hasidim sought a direct, spontaneous religious experience of life, and created a great tradition of laughing saints and wonderful stories. &quot;In a language simple but yet profound, the master Osho indicates the art of 'dying' by learning how to live in the here and now, the eternal life.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3ab0b7d4461a7de48ded72eb8500735b90bde5c","amp;dn":"osho+discourse+The+Art+of+Dying+pdf+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3ab0b7d4461a7de48ded72eb8500735b90bde5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,171,11,125,68,97,167,222,72,222,215,46,184,80,7,53,185,11,222,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
