At the shop, she sells used items that she has lovingly refurbished and repurposed. But her favorite pet project so far has been adopting a stray cat she names Elvis.\n\nElvis has seen nine livesÃ¢â‚¬â€and then some. The big black cat with a scar across his nose turned up at a local bar when the band was playing the King of Rock and RollÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music and hopped in SarahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s truck. Since then, he has been her constant companion and the furry favorite of everyone who comes into the store.\n\nAnd a helpful sleuth to boot! When SarahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elderly friend Maddie is found with the body of a dead man in her garden, the kindly old lady becomes the prime suspect in the murder. Even SarahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s old high school flame, investigator Nick Elliot, seems convinced that Maddie was up to no good. So itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to Sarah and Elvis to clear her friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s name and make sure the real murderer doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get a second chance. \n\nGenre: Cozy Mystery","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:588a925b1604ca03644e70cf23019c7d00784699","amp;dn":"The+Whole+Cat+and+Caboodle+by+Sofie+Ryan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"588a925b1604ca03644e70cf23019c7d00784699","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,138,146,91,22,4,202,3,100,78,112,207,35,1,156,125,0,120,70,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
