The original series ran for three seasons on ABC from January 1959 to July 1961.\n\nCreated by Merwin Gerard and produced by Collier Young, One Step Beyond was hosted by John Newland, &quot;your guide to the supernatural&quot; (also credited as &quot;Our guide into the world of the unknown&quot;). Newland presented tales that explored paranormal events and various situations that defied &quot;logical&quot; explanation. Unlike other anthology programmers, the ABC network series episodes were presented in the form of straightforward thirty-minute docudramas, all said to be based on true events. Initially, the program included the corporate name of sponsor Alcoa as part of its full title.\n\nOne Step Beyond filled the time slot at 10 p.m. Tuesday vacated by the crime/police reality show Confession.\n\nAmong its varied tales, One Step Beyond dealt with premonition of death (&quot;The Lincoln Assassination&quot;) and disaster (&quot;Tidal Wave&quot;, &quot;Night of April 14th&quot;); astral projection (&quot;The Long Call&quot;); the existence of ghosts (&quot;The Last Time&quot;); and wildly improbable coincidence (&quot;The Glider&quot;, &quot;Death on the Mountain&quot;, etc.).\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Step_Beyond_(TV_series)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Step_Beyond_(TV_series)&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tv.com/shows/one-step-beyond/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tv.com/shows/one-step-beyond/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n1x02 - Night Of April 14th\n1x04 - The Dark Room\n1x07 - The Dream\n1x09 - The Dead Part Of The House\n1x10 - The Vision\n1x11 - The Devil's Laughter\n1x12 - The Return Of Mitchell Campion\n1x14 - The Secret\n1x15 - The Aerialist\n1x19 - The Captain's Guests\n1x20 - Echo\n1x21 - Front Runner\n\n2x01 - Delusion\n2x02 - Ordeal On Locust Street\n2x03 - Brainwave\n2x04 - Doomsday\n2x06 - The Inheritance\n2x07 - The Open Window\n2x08 - Message From Clara\n2x09 - Forked Lightning\n2x11 - Dead Ringer\n2x14 - Make Me Not A Witch\n2x15 - The Hand\n2x17 - Earthquake\n2x20 - Who Are You\n2x22 - The Lovers\n2x23 - Vanishing Point\n2x26 - The Explorer\n2x27 - The Clown\n2x28 - I Saw You Tomorrow\n2x30 - The Peter Hurkos Story - Part 1\n2x31 - The Peter Hurkos Story - Part 2\n2x32 - Delia\n2x33 - The Visitor\n2x34 - Gypsy\n2x39 - The Storm\n\n3x01 - Tidal Wave\n3x02 - Anniversary Of A Murder\n3x06 - Moment Of Hate\n3x07 - To Know The End\n3x08 - The Trap\n3x11 - Tonight At 12-17\n3x12 - Where Are They\n3x13 - Legacy Of Love\n3x15 - The Executioner\n3x16-  The Last Round\n3x17 - Dead Man's Tale\n3x20 - Person Unknown\n3x21 - Night Of Decision\n3x23 - Justice","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd782015ebdc5ce2bc065448ceebc028ba8d8109","amp;dn":"One+Step+Beyond+-+1959-61+Supernatural+Anthology+-+50+Episodes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd782015ebdc5ce2bc065448ceebc028ba8d8109","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,120,32,21,235,220,92,226,188,6,84,72,206,235,192,40,186,141,129,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
