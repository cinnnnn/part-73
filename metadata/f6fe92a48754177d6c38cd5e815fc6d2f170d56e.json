Sparks also fly when she encounters Johnny, whose heroic work in bomb disposal makes him very attractive to many women Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but Sam's determined not to fall for his charm. Sally wants nothing more than to protect her small children while her husband is a prisoner of war. She works hard doing shifts in a factory and singing at the Grafton ballroom, confessing to no-one the shameful reason why she needs two jobs. But help is at hand, from a most unlikely source. This stirring tale of women fighting together to do their bit for their country, keep their families together and finding love and fulfilment in the process will delight her fans and win her many more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6fe92a48754177d6c38cd5e815fc6d2f170d56e","amp;dn":"As+Time+Goes+%28World+War+II%2C+%234%29+-+Annie+Groves","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6fe92a48754177d6c38cd5e815fc6d2f170d56e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,254,146,164,135,84,23,125,108,56,205,94,129,95,198,210,241,112,213,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
