We couldn't exist without each other.&quot;\n\nFor me, life was simple. I went to school and studied. I spent time with my friends and stayed out of trouble. I didn't drink or swear and I only dated gentlemen. I was the typical good girl with a bright future. My world seemed perfect. \n\nBut that was about to change.\n\nRyder Delaney was the one imperfection in my life. He was the bad boy, the black sheep, the one your mother always warned you about. He had only one hard-and-fast rule - Don't fall in love. \n\nBut some rules were meant to be broken.\n\nWe were best friends, inseparable since childhood despite our differences. I knew the real man hiding behind the tattoos and bad attitude. He knew all my secrets and dreams. But he didn't know there was one thing I wanted and couldn't have...him.\n\nBut sometimes Fate has a way of intervening. Soon our world collapsed. War erupted. Darkness prevailed. Alone and on the run, our only goal was to survive and to ignore the feelings we had for each other. But love is powerful...\n\nand so is the darkness.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2b9bfb62dca2d39da42b99983af76d35f6483a4","amp;dn":"Promise+Me+Darkness+by+Paige+Weaver+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2b9bfb62dca2d39da42b99983af76d35f6483a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,185,191,182,45,202,45,57,218,66,185,153,131,175,118,211,95,100,131,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
