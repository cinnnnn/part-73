The main focus of this book, discussed in Part I, gives a\nclose reading of the final form of the text; the Hebrew Ezra, the\nHebrew Nehemiah, 1 Esdras and other Ezra and Nehemiah\ntraditions. Lester L.Grabbe also discusses intertextuality and\nquestions of historicity raised by a close reading of the texts.\nThis book presents a unique approach to Ezra-Nehemiah in the\ncombination of literary and historical approaches. Lester L.Grabbe\nchallenges commonly held assumptions about Joshua and\nZerubbabel, the initial resettlement of land after the exile, the\nfigure of Ezra and the activities of Nehemiah. Controversially, the\nchallenge comes, nor from radical theory, but from paying careful\nattention to the text of the Bible itself.\nLester L.Grabbe is Professor of Hebrew Bible and Early Judaism\nat the University of Hull.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfbadfb8aeeca58046580dbe696c8b05315b09b4","amp;dn":"Grabbe_Lester-Ezra-Nehemiah","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfbadfb8aeeca58046580dbe696c8b05315b09b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,186,223,184,174,236,165,128,70,88,13,190,105,108,139,5,49,91,9,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
