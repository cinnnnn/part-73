King of My Love\n\nThe Works, Jonatha Brooke's seventh solo release, is a full-length album of previously unheard lyrics by Woody Guthrie, set to original music written and performed by Brooke. Brooke is one of a select group of artists to be invited into the Guthrie Archives to create new works from his vast collection of lyrics, prose, poetry and artwork. Brooke co-produced The Works with the legendary Bob Clearmountain (Bruce Springsteen, The Rolling Stones). Recorded over a two-month period in New York City, several acclaimed musicians including keyboardist Joe Sample (Eric Clapton, B.B. King), bassist Christian McBride (Sting, Diana Krall), drummer Steve Gadd (Paul Simon, Eric Clapton), and steel guitarist Greg Leisz (Joni Mitchell, k.d. lang, Wilco), joined Brooke in the studio. The album features duets with artists Keb' Mo' on 'All You Gotta Do Is Touch Me'; Eric Bazilian on 'There's More True Lovers Than One' ; Glen Phillips on 'Sweetest Angel'; with a special guest appearance by Derek Trucks playing slide guitar on 'New Star.'\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7f84a16675764eac90a7fb768a75266554c3acb","amp;dn":"Jonatha+Brooke+-+The+Works+%5B2008%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7f84a16675764eac90a7fb768a75266554c3acb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,248,74,22,103,87,100,234,201,10,127,183,104,167,82,102,85,76,58,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
