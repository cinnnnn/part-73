With the software users can encrypt old MS-DOS style disk partitions as well as modern volumes residing on a number of physical disk devices, for example Spanned, Striped, Mirrored or RAID-5 volumes. BestCrypt Volume Encryption can encrypt volumes where Windows boots from, as well as the volume where Windows stores its system files (including Registry, Page file and Hibernate file). Initial encryption is transparent both for running applications and for Windows system modules. BestCrypt Volume Encryption performs Computer Pre-Boot Authentication if system or boot volume/partition is encrypted. It means that BestCrypt Volume Encryption loads before operating system and allows computer to boot only after entering a proper password. BestCrypt Volume Encryption provides an easy way to customize Pre-Boot Authentication texts appeared when the user is required to enter password. The feature allows displaying additional hints when the user is being prompted to enter a password and even hide the fact that pre-boot authentication is running.\n\nMain Features\nEncrypts all types of volumes residing on fixed and removable disks: \nSimple volume, i.e. volume consisting of one disk partition. \nMount point - volume mounted as a sub-folder on NTFS-formatted volume. \nMultipartition volume, i.e. volume consisting of several disk partitions: \nSpanned volumes; \nMirrored volumes; \nStriped volumes; \nRAID-5 volumes. \n\nBestCrypt Volume Encryption allows encrypting data with many strong encryption algorithms. Every algorithm is implemented with the largest possible key size defined in the algorithm's specification:\n\nAES (Rijndael) - 256-bit key. \nRC6 - 256-bit key. \nSerpent - 256-bit key. \nTwofish - 256-bit key.\n\nBestCrypt Volume Encryption utilizes XTS Encryption Mode with all encryption algorithms listed above. XTS Mode is specially designed for applications working on disk sector level and more secure than other popular modes used earlier, like LRW or CBC mode. \nBestCrypt Volume Encryption supports hardware tokens Aladdin eToken R2 and PRO as a secure hardware storage for encryption keys. With hardware token users get two levels of protection for encrypted data, because in addition to password it is necessary to connect small hardware token where encryption key is stored.\nBestCrypt Volume Encryption provides Secure Hibernating. If user encrypts volume where Windows stores Hibernate File, BestCrypt Volume Encryption encrypts all write operations when Windows goes into Hibernate state and decrypts read operations when the computer wakes up from Hibernate state. Since pre-boot authentication is necessary at wake-up time, only the user who knows the proper password (and has hardware token, if used) can run computer from Hibernate mode. Secure Hibernating is a functionality that must be implemented in such software as BestCrypt Volume Encryption, otherwise all data written at Hibernate time (together with encryption keys) appears on disk in opened decrypted form.\n\nAs well as Hibernate File, BestCrypt Volume Encryption encrypts Windows Crash Dump Files. Windows writes files in a very special way, because when a crash occurs, regular disk write operations cannot be used. Without encrypting Crash Dump Files the security level of the software were significantly lower, because the files can store a snapshot of memory together with encryption keys on disk in opened decrypted form. \n\nBestCrypt Volume Encryption supports a number of rescue functions allowing users to decrypt volumes if a serious disk crash occurs. \n\nBestCrypt Volume Encryption Plugin for BartPE bootable CD/DVD is available. The user can boot computer with encrypted volume using the bootable CD/DVD and run BestCrypt Volume Encryption commands directly from the CD/DVD. The functionality can be extremely useful for various recovering purposes. \n\nBesides of the functionality that must be in such kind of software, BestCrypt Volume Encryption cares about convenience in using the software: \nIf some folders on encrypted volume are shared for network access, BestCrypt Volume Encryption will automatically restore the shares when the user mounts the volume. The software stores information about shared folders in encrypted form. \nBestCrypt Volume Encryption allows optional mounting not system volumes automatically before computer starts loading operating system (&quot;Mount at Boot Time&quot; option). \nThe software allows per-user setting for mounting not system volumes when the user logs on (&quot;Mount at Logon&quot; option). \nThe software has an option to hide drive letters for volumes that are not mounted. The option allows avoiding accidental formatting not mounted encrypted volumes. \nBestCrypt Volume Encryption can display contents of physical sectors, relatively to physical disk or logical volume. The sectors' data can be saved to file or restored from file.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84393a262d8dc46209628c722172d3232d4fcc9d","amp;dn":"Jetico+BestCrypt+8.25.7+%2B+Keyfilemaker.and.Patch-CRD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84393a262d8dc46209628c722172d3232d4fcc9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,57,58,38,45,141,196,98,9,98,140,114,33,114,211,35,45,79,204,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
