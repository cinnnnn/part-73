He also takes a look at an obscene comment by Rep. Josh Miller in response to defenders of the Second Amendment and the Bill of Rights. \n\nInvestigative journalist Greg Palast talks with Alex about the role of British Petroleum in the devastating Exxon Valdez disaster 25 years ago. Palast is the author of a number of books, including The Best Democracy Money Can Buy and Vultures Picnic. \n\nAlex also talks with Florida attorney Todd Allen, who represented a couple who sued Bank of America after it tried to incorrectly foreclose on their home. After demonstrating in court they owned the home and did not owe the bank, Bank of America refused to pay attorney fees and other costs associated with the case.\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
