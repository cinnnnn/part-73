Rebecca represents her at an Employment Tribunal.\n\n2 - Tilting the Odds: An equine vet is charged with doping a racehorse. Rebecca represents him at a professional disciplinary hearing.\n\n3 - Safe House: A man is accused of being a suspected terrorist and is subject to a control order. Rebecca is the Special Advocate at a closed hearing.\n\nIn each case, there is no clear line where right lies. Each of the protagonists has to some extent brought their current misfortune on themselves and the outcome is not always clear cut.\n\nAn intelligently written and thoughtful set of dramas.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e21528eb4b57de68c1cf69a172a894d0fdda0c3d","amp;dn":"Behind+Closed+Doors+-+Radio+Dramas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e21528eb4b57de68c1cf69a172a894d0fdda0c3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,21,40,235,75,87,222,104,193,207,105,161,114,168,148,208,253,218,12,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
