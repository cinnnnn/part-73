The siblings, who have lost both their parents, are unusually attached, and Hayes fears his untoward secret feelings for his sister. \n\nThis rich backstory is intercut with scenes of his soul-altering hours on the march and at the frontÃ¢â‚¬â€the slaughter of barely grown young men who only days before whooped it up with him in a regimental ball game; his temporary deafness and disorientation after a shell blast; his fevered attempt to find safe haven after he has been deserted by his own comradesÃ¢â‚¬â€and, later, in a Washington military hospital, where he finds himself mute and unable even to write his name. \n\nIn this twilit realm, among the people he encountersÃ¢â‚¬â€including a compassionate drug-addicted amputee, the ward matron who only appears to be his enemy, and the captain who is convinced that Hayes is faking his illnessÃ¢â‚¬â€is a gray-bearded eccentric who visits the ward daily and becomes HayesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strongest advocate: Walt Whitman. This timeless story, whose outcome hinges on friendships forged in crisis, reminds us that the injuries of war are manifold, and the healing goodness in the human soul runs deep and strong.\n\nGenre: Historical Fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea692cb0d085621499b1bb7c9263fe8deae5a4c7","amp;dn":"Nostalgia+by+Dennis+McFarland","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea692cb0d085621499b1bb7c9263fe8deae5a4c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,105,44,176,208,133,98,20,153,177,187,124,146,99,254,141,234,229,164,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
