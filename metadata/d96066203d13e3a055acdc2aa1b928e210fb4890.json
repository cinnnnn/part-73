The tour was founded in 2005 with dates across North America, and the 2006 and 2007 line-ups also traveled to Australia. The bands appearing at the festival were chosen by Mustaine because he wanted to &quot;put together a festival that consisted of positive bands that play heavy music in a high energy environment.&quot;[1] The tour is set as an alternative to tours such as Ozzfest.[2] The name &quot;Gigantour&quot; was inspired by the classic 1960s anime Gigantor.[1] The most recent Gigantour took place in 2013.\n\nGigantour 2 DVD (2008, Image Entertainment)\n\nConcert footage - (66 mins):\n\nThe Smash-Up Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬ËœEffigyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\nSanctity Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬ËœBeneath The MachineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\nInto Eternity Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬ËœSevere Emotional DistressÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\nOverkill Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬ËœNecroshineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\nOverkill Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬ËœRotten To The CoreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\nArch Enemy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬ËœWe Will RiseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\nArch Enemy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬ËœNemesisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\nOpeth Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Leper AffinityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\nLamb Of God Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬ËœVigilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\nLamb Of God Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬ËœNow YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve Got Something To Die ForÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\nMegadeth Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬ËœTake No PrisonersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\nMegadeth Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe ScorpionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\nMegadeth Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬ËœWashington Is NextÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\nBonus Material Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (60 mins):\n\nBehind The Scenes documentary\nMegadeth Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬ËœPeace SellsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (bonus track)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d96066203d13e3a055acdc2aa1b928e210fb4890","amp;dn":"Gigantour+2+Megadeth%2C+Lamb+of+God%2C+Opeth%2C+Arch+Enemy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d96066203d13e3a055acdc2aa1b928e210fb4890","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,96,102,32,61,19,227,160,85,172,220,42,161,185,40,226,16,251,72,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
