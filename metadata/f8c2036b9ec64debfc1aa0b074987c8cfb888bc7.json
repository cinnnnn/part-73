Though a few of his singles -- &quot;Rubber Ball,&quot; for one -- were as innocuous as anything else from the era, Vee had a knack for infectious Brill Building pop, thanks to his ebullient voice as well as the cadre of songwriters standing behind him.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bobby-vee-p5750/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bobby-vee-p5750/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-ep-collection-r417171&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-ep-collection-r417171&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000ILP5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000ILP5&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
