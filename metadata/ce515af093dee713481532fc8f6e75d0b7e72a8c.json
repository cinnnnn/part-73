The British and German soldiers marched off to war with secret 'vest pocket' cameras, determined to record what they thought would be a great adventure, but few were prepared for the horrors they were about to witness and photograph. Their photos - many never seen before in public - provide a deeply moving document of their lives in the trenches and their rapid loss of innocence.\n\nWith no soldier photographer alive to tell the tale, we join their close relatives on emotional journeys of discovery as they go in search of the secrets hidden within their ancestors' photographs.\n\nThis is the war viewed from a new and surprising perspective - through the eyes of the men who fought in it.\n\nInfo\nVideo Format: AVI\nVideo Bitrate: 1531kbps\nFrame Width: 720\nFram Height: 400\nAudio Format: MP3\nAudio Bitrate: 128kbps\nFilesise: 700MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce515af093dee713481532fc8f6e75d0b7e72a8c","amp;dn":"BBC.Hidden.Histories.WW1s.Forgotten.Photographs.2014.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce515af093dee713481532fc8f6e75d0b7e72a8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,81,90,240,147,222,231,19,72,21,50,252,143,110,117,208,183,231,42,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
