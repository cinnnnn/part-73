Smart Mac owners use it to save time on repetitive tasks and control the many other applications that live on your system, including the Adobe and Microsoft Office suites. This project-based course shows how to build a real-world app that adds metadata and a watermark to image files, using some built-in logic to discover whether the users have Photoshop installed on their computer. Using this example script, author Scott Simpson walks you through the syntax, features, and common gotchas of AppleScript.\nTopics include:\n\n    What is AppleScript?\n    Using comments, variables, text, and numbers\n    Working with files and folders\n    Using conditionals and creating loops\n    Building functions\n    Controlling other programs with AppleScript\n    Preventing and catching errors\n    Distributing your AppleScript application\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91ac6475e07db3a4ee02ee462e3bc6846e584f3e","amp;dn":"Up+and+Running+with+AppleScript","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91ac6475e07db3a4ee02ee462e3bc6846e584f3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,172,100,117,224,125,179,164,238,2,238,70,46,59,198,132,110,88,79,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
