Her parents don't believe her, nor does her fiancÃƒÂ©. The only one who understands is the eccentric local inventor and her longtime companion, Turri.\n\nWhen her eyesight dims forever, Carolina can no longer see her beloved lake or the rich hues of her own dresses. But as darkness erases her world, she discovers one place she can still see-in her dreams. Carolina creates a vivid dreaming life, in which she can not only see, but also fly, exploring lands she had never known.\n\nDesperate to communicate with Carolina, Turri invents a peculiar machine for her: the world's first typewriter. His gift ignites a passionate love affair that will change both of their lives forever.\n\nGenre: Historical Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b702a459b14d5b8c67163e16a6131a8587618c0e","amp;dn":"The+Blind+Contessa%27s+New+Machine+by+Carey+Wallace","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b702a459b14d5b8c67163e16a6131a8587618c0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,2,164,89,177,77,91,140,103,22,62,22,166,19,26,133,135,97,140,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
