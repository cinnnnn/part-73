These are the interviews between the retired players \n\nabout the game on both sides. It is neat to see what they look like today.\n\nRipped from the DVD's that were recorded in VHS quality and aged over time.\n\nWell worth download if you are into classic baseball games. This compliments\n\nthe 1975 World Series I uploaded a few weeks ago. I hope you like it. You won't\n\nfind it anywhere else...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2acc57bfd33ee9327aa6329a9ae5d5a21dd3449","amp;dn":"1975+World+Series+Extras+%28Boston+and+Cincinnati%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2acc57bfd33ee9327aa6329a9ae5d5a21dd3449","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,172,197,123,253,51,238,147,39,170,99,41,169,174,93,90,33,221,52,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
