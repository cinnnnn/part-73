It ended in February/March 2014.\n\nThis course explores the mathematical theory of two player games without chance moves. We will cover simplifying games, determining when games are equivalent to numbers, and impartial games. Many of the examples will be with simple games that may be new to you: Hackenbush, Nim, Push, Toads and Frogs, and others. While this probably wonÃ‚â€™t make you a better chess or go player, the course will give you a better insight into the structure of games.\n\nMore information about this course is available at https://coursera.org/course/cgt\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6757833f19cb4891e8683919f9f0b545d7a737dc","amp;dn":"%5BCoursera%5D+Games+without+Chance+-+Combinatorial+Game+Theory","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6757833f19cb4891e8683919f9f0b545d7a737dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,87,131,63,25,203,72,145,232,104,57,25,249,240,181,69,215,167,55,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
