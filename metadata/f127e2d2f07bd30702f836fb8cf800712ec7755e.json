The quaint, homespun quality of the material -- much of it recorded at Cotten's home with her grandchildren looking on in silence -- adds immensely to its intimacy and warmth; the sound quality varies wildly from track to track, but the amazing instrumental work shines through regardless on tracks like the opening &quot;Wilson Rag&quot; and the now-standard &quot;Freight Train.&quot; (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01.
