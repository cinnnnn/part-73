The film is based on a story by Harold Greene and Rowland Brown and stars John Payne, Coleen Gray, Preston Foster, Neville Brand and Lee Van Cleef.\nOur overall rating for Kansas City Confidential is: very good, a satisfying piece of cinema that impresses both in its direction and writing - a treat for anyone who can appreciate great cinema.\n\nSnow Leopard from Ohio 12 October 2005:\nThis absorbing crime drama is also one of the most well-crafted movies of its genre. It tells its story with few frills, but with plenty of interesting details and a well-timed pace. John Payne gets one of his best roles, with a very good supporting cast. A strong sense of danger and uncertainty is built up early, and is effectively carried through the whole movie, right up to the end.\n\nPayne is well-cast as an ex-convict who gets framed by a very clever criminal mastermind, and who then determines to seek out the truth. In itself, the setup is a familiar one, but &quot;Kansas City Confidential&quot; gets quite a lot out of it, and it is hardly predictable. \n\nThe story moves from one hazardous situation to the next, with very little pause for relief, maintaining the tension constantly. Preston Foster is also very well-suited for his role as the ex-police captain, and the roles of the three lowlifes are well-acted by Neville Brand and young-looking Lee Van Cleef and Jack Elam. \n\nThe atmosphere and characters both work particularly well. The story has perhaps a couple of implausible turns, but in itself it is so carefully constructed that this really doesn't matter. Director Phil Karlson certainly deserves praise for putting things together so well. Very few B-movies are this well-conceived, and as a result it still holds up very well. \n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 0.97b\nDuration.... 01:35:25\nCodec.......
