It will help you build your site in no time to your liking with minimal effort. It empowers you to set any color to elements such as backgrounds, links, text, menu links, etc. You can completely change the look and feel of your site in seconds. You can also choose from over 500 fonts, including Google Font Directory and CufÃƒÂ³n fonts. This number will grow with time since many new fonts are being added to the Google fonts library. The theme also features 6 (six) Home page sliders for you to choose from.\n\nSEO (Search Engine Optimization) has been made a priority when designing the U-Design theme. In the code hierarchy, the main content block is placed before the sidebar regardless of the sidebar position, so it is crawled first by search engines. Another very powerful SEO feature has been implemented regarding Heading (h1, h2, h3,...) tags in that on the Home page the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœh1Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ tag is assigned to the site name and the rest of pages/posts/archives etc., the main Title has been assigned an Ã¢â‚¬Ëœh1Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ tag.\nRead a review by TopHatRank.com\n\nResponsive &amp; Mobile Ready!!!
