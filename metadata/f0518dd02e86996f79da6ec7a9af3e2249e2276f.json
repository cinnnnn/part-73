Atlanta's Tender Idols positioned themselves at the head of that pack -- and not just because they boasted their very own British-born frontman, Ian Webber, for extra credibility. At their best on this ten-song debut, Tender Idols match the efforts of past-plundering bands like Oasis and Blur; given that the songs are served up with a smile instead of a sneer, it's tempting to say they're better. Whichever is true, there's no arguing with the breathless, jangly rush of &quot;For Love I'd Die&quot; or the heartfelt balladry of &quot;Sunlovers.&quot; Tender Idols do fall prey to some of the same weaknesses that afflicted many of their U.K. contemporaries: showing off on a blustering bluesy yawner (&quot;International&quot;) and working a bit too close to Morrissey's bed (&quot;Realife&quot;). Such failings can only be redeemed with a dose of good, old-fashioned singalong pop -- and luckily, there's enough of it here to do the trick.
