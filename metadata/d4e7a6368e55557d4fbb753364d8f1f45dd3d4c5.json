Water: A Comprehensive Guide for Brewers, third in Brewers PublicationsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Brewing Elements series, takes the mystery out of waterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s role in the brewing process. From an overview on sources, quality and geography, the book leads brewers through how to read water reports, understanding flavor contributions, and the treatment and chemistry of brewing water. A discussion of adjusting water to styles of beer, residual alkalinity, malt acidity, mash pH, brewery process water and wastewater treatment is included. By How to Brew author John Palmer and professional brewer Colin Kaminski.\n\npdf-9.9mb-638 pages","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4e7a6368e55557d4fbb753364d8f1f45dd3d4c5","amp;dn":"Water+A+Comprehensive+Guide+for+Brewers+by+John+Palmer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4e7a6368e55557d4fbb753364d8f1f45dd3d4c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,231,166,54,142,85,85,125,79,187,117,51,100,216,241,244,93,211,212,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
