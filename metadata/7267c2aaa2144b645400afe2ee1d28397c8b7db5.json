Nothing fancy, nothing particularly thought out.  Quickly assembled.  Written and recorded at the same time.  Using simple tools at my disposal.  Humble everything, not an attempt at fame.  Just a challenge. \n\nVolumes 1-3 are pulled from 60 demos written in a 2 week span at the start of 2013.  There will be more volumes to follow.\n\n\nVolume 3\n\nIn Limbo\nMy God\nStuck In The Mud\nDonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Let It Go To Your Head\nMe And My Dinosaur\nThe HookerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Reunion\nDivorce Blues\nTranquilizer\nBlack Hole\nOde To Fans","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7267c2aaa2144b645400afe2ee1d28397c8b7db5","amp;dn":"Gherkin+Off+Volume+3-The+Pickled+People","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7267c2aaa2144b645400afe2ee1d28397c8b7db5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,103,194,170,162,20,75,100,84,0,175,226,238,29,40,57,124,139,125,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
