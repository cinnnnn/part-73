Similar to Dropbox but files stay on your computer. BitTorrent Sync skips the cloud to deliver your files at lightning speed. No matter where you are. Create a Sync folder for your stuff. Open it on any computer, phone, or tablet. Access docs, share photos, and start working from anywhere. Use the Android app and share between your computer and Android device.\n\nPlease remember to seed!\n\nFeel free to comment below!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:198b643932ada43d9621d99d2c213f1d14435cd7","amp;dn":"BitTorrent+Sync+Beta+Windows","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"198b643932ada43d9621d99d2c213f1d14435cd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,139,100,57,50,173,164,61,150,33,217,157,44,33,63,29,20,67,92,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
