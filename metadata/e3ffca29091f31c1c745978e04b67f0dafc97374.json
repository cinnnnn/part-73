Basically, it is a catalog of &quot;pretty much&quot; every Phish show in \n\ncirculation from before 10/07/2000 (Phish ended their first hiatus on \n\n12/31/2002, and henceforth all recordings have been available via LivePhish).  \n\nSome are SBD, but by far mostly AUD; all have recording info; all are tagged, \n\nand even have artwork which corresponds to the ticket stub or venue; NONE of \n\nthis is in FLAC:  This is exactly how this torrent was seeded about 5 years \n\nago.  Some are 320, but most are lower bitrates.  However, the point is that \n\nmany - if not most - of these recordings are not available at \n\nbt.etree.org...but if they are, I heartily suggest you head over there and \n\ndownload that and any other shows you like in wonderful FLAC.  If I find that \n\nany of these shows are available via bt.etree.org in FLAC I will upload that \n\nas well.  I am offering this collection up because it is comprehensive:  it \n\nreally does comprise almost every Phish show in circulation from before the \n\nfirst hiatus.  I am really anal about FLAC/320 just like most of you, but the \n\nvast majority of these shows offered here are not presently available in the \n\nbittorrent community in any other format (although, once again, some are \n\navailable at bt.etree.org, and some though Phish.com).\n\nThis is the sixth of roughly 50 torrents which comprise the whole collection, \n\nwhich goes from 1984 - 2000, and the last for 1993.  August 1993 is one of \n\nthose top-shelf, month-long, superlative moments in Phish history, along with \n\nFall 1997 and April 1992, for example.\n\nHere are the shows included in this installment, 1993 part 06:\n\n1993-08-02 Ritz Theatre, Tampa FL (AUD)\n1993-08-03 Bayfront Park Amphitheater, Miami FL (AUD)\n1993-08-06 Cincinnati Zoo Peacock Pavilion, Cincinnati OH (MTX)\n1993-08-07 Darien Lake Performing Arts Center, Darien NY (AUD)\n1993-08-08 Nautica Stage, Cleveland OH (AUD)\n1993-08-09 Concert Hall, Toronto, Ontario, Canada (AUD)\n1993-08-11 Eastbrook Theatre, Grand Rapids MI (AUD)\n1993-08-12 Meadow Brook Music Festival, Rochester Hills MI (AUD)\n1993-08-13 Murat Theatre, Indianapolis IN (AR)\n1993-08-14 World Music Theatre, Tinley Park IL (LPS)\n1993-08-15 The Macauley Theater, Louisville KY (AUD)\n1993-08-16 American Theater, St. Louis MO (AUD)\n1993-08-17 Memorial Hall, Kansas City MO (AUD)\n1993-08-20 Red Rocks Amphitheatre, Morrison CO (SBD)\n1993-08-21 Salt Air, Salt Lake City UT (AUD)\n1993-08-24 Commodore Ballroom, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada (SBD)\n1993-08-25 Paramount Theatre, Seattle WA (AUD)\n1993-08-26 Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall, Portland OR (AUD)\n1993-08-28 Greek Theatre, Berkeley CA (SBD)\n1993-12-28 Bender Arena, American University, Washington DC (AUD)\n1993-12-29 New Haven Veterans Memorial Coliseum, New Haven CT (AUD)\n1993-12-30 Cumberland County Civic Center, Portland ME (MTX)\n1993-12-31 Worcester Centrum Centre, Worcester MA (FM)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3ffca29091f31c1c745978e04b67f0dafc97374","amp;dn":"Phish+-+PMCLP+1993+Part+6+%28Pretty+Much+Complete+Live+Phish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3ffca29091f31c1c745978e04b67f0dafc97374","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,255,202,41,9,31,49,193,199,69,151,142,4,182,127,13,175,201,115,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
