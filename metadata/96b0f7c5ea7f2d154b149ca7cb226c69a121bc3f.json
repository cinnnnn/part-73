A fusion of East and West, old and new, Sharq (Orient) is the placement of Eastern melody and its unique expressiveness in a new context that propels it forward as a complete medium of expression. Combining elements of mawwal, tarab, muwashah, samai, qadd, longa, and sufi, this concert recording is a unique musical biography.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96b0f7c5ea7f2d154b149ca7cb226c69a121bc3f","amp;dn":"Marcel+Khalife+-+2007+-+Sharq+%28Live+at+Piacenza+Theatre%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96b0f7c5ea7f2d154b149ca7cb226c69a121bc3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,176,247,197,234,127,45,21,75,20,156,167,203,34,108,105,161,33,188,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
