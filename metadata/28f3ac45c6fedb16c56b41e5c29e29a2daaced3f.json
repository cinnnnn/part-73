You can easily burn it through using Nero or iMGBurn\n\nRunning Time 1hr 31mins    Rated-R\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115734/?ref_=sr_1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115734/?ref_=sr_1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWes Anderson first illustrated his lovingly detailed, slightly surreal cinematic vision in this witty and warm portrait of three young middle-class misfits. Fresh out of a mental hospital, gentle Anthony (Luke Wilson) finds himself once again embroiled in the machinations of his best friend, elaborate schemer Dignan (Owen Wilson). With the aid of getaway driver Bob (Robert Musgrave), they develop a needlessly complex, mildly successful plan to rob a small bookstore - then go &quot;on the lam.&quot; Also featuring Lumi Cavazos as Inez, the South American housekeeper Anthony falls in love with, and James Caan as local thief extraordinaire Mr. Henry, Bottle Rocket is a charming, hilarious, affectionate look at the folly of dreamers. Shot against radiant southwestern backdrops, it's the film that put Anderson and the Wilson brothers on the map.\n\nMenus-Yes\nExtras-Yes\n\nSpecial Features including\nNew, restored high-definition digital transfer, supervised and approved by director Wes Anderson and cinematographer Robert Yeoman, with Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack\nAudio commentary featuring Anderson and co-writer/actor Owen Wilson\n\n\nLet's get this SEEDED people!!
