The third edition has been revised and streamlined, with fresh examples and updated statistical information throughout. Chapters eight and nine have been combined into a comprehensive chapter about discrimination as a non-merit barrier to upward mobility. The book also features a new section on Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Great Recession.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe Meritocracy Myth examines talent, attitude, work ethic, and character as elements of merit and evaluates the effect of non-merit factors such as social status, race, heritage, and wealth on meritocracy. A compelling book on an often-overlooked topic, The Meritocracy Myth has become a classroom classic to introduce students to this provocative topic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f358521259cf5d042016cf4e1d407dc2a9fdcafe","amp;dn":"The+Meritocracy+Myth%2C+3rd+Edition+%282014%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f358521259cf5d042016cf4e1d407dc2a9fdcafe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,88,82,18,89,207,93,4,32,22,207,78,29,64,125,194,169,253,202,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
