In the past, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen the trainers join forces to help singles, couples and families lose weight. This time, they'll take on the remarkable task of saving an entire town.\n\nArarat in western Victoria is one of AustraliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most overweight towns, with 68% of the adult population being overweight or obese. The trainers will take 14 local champions and the rest of the town on a journey to weight loss, health and fitness.\n\nIt's never been done on this scale before, anywhere. The Biggest Loser: Challenge Australia is sure to surprise, entertain, inspire and prove that obesity in Australian communities can indeed be overcome.\n\nIn the elimination aftermath, it's time for the trainers to pick the three contestants each will train until the finale. Later, the contestants start to prepare for the catwalk as their makeovers begin.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5479061f35ac42299d3d5dacff643b7b2b49c788","amp;dn":"The.Biggest.Loser.AU.s09e25.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5479061f35ac42299d3d5dacff643b7b2b49c788","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,121,6,31,53,172,66,41,157,61,93,172,255,100,59,123,43,73,199,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
