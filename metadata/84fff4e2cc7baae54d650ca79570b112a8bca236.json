Blu. Black starts with the lovely &quot;Blue&quot; and ends with a juke joint blues called &quot;Black,&quot; so it's obvious what terrain Harris is mapping out here, but in between he gently works in some Americanized roots reggae, some quiet storm-type ballads, and odds and ends of other Afro-matrixed musical ephemera, and amazingly, he does it with a calm, assured, and extremely positive voice that is as welcome as it is vital. One hesitates to call this stuff blues, although it certainly is blues-informed (but then so is 99 percent of what you hear on the radio, really). A winning singer with an easy charm, Harris shines here on songs (most of them were co-written with keyboardist and producer Chris &quot;Peanut&quot; Whitley) like &quot;King and Queen&quot; (a duet with Davina Jackson), the straight-out-of-Kingston-sounding &quot;Conquering Lion,&quot; the sunny skanking &quot;Run Around Girl,&quot; and a moving, stark solo version of Burning Spear's &quot;Columbus.&quot; It all goes down easy, and Harris' naturally positive tone makes this album yet another treat from this gifted musician.
