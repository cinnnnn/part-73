We've put these versions together to create a special limited edition solo acoustic album called &quot;The Mistakes Are Intentional&quot; which you can buy even before &quot;Wallis Bird&quot; comes out in 2012!\n\nSo for those of you who can't wait for the release of &quot;Wallis Bird&quot;, this will give you a very special acoustic preview of the songs that will be on it. For the collectors among you, it's rather like a companion edition to 'Wallis Bird&quot; &amp; early christmas present!\n\nThe solo versions were recorded in Wallis' home in London during the summer of 2011. Of course the album &quot;Wallis Bird&quot; will feature her full band once again, so &quot;The Mistakes are Intentional&quot; contains very intimate, acoustic interpretations of the same songs that will appear on 'Wallis Bird&quot;. There's also a special bonus track of 'Be Prepared', a song which she often performs live but has never before been recorded. The solo acoustic CD is packaged in a wallet which has been hand-stitched by Wallis herself, and there will only be 1,000 pressed so get yours while stocks last!\n\nThe solo versions were recorded in Wallis' home in London during the summer of 2011.
