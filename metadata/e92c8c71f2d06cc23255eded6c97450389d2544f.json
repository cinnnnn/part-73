What she (apparently) doesn't know is that her son is gay, and by marrying Betty he is not only ensuring his financial future, but also - he thinks - helping himself and his mother keep up appearances.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e92c8c71f2d06cc23255eded6c97450389d2544f","amp;dn":"The+Shielding+of+Mrs+Forbes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e92c8c71f2d06cc23255eded6c97450389d2544f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,44,140,113,242,208,108,194,50,85,237,237,108,151,69,3,137,210,84,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
