It was the right time to record the nine original tracks that compose their homonymous album, Ã¢â‚¬ËœLa Blanche AlchimieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\nTheir influences come from the most eclectic array of styles always searching for a captivating and personal way of expression. \n\nTheir songs are like magic dreams made of fairy tales and refined talking instruments.\nFederico is a multi-instrumentalist who faces music in a sophisticated and whirling way. His piano and guitar notes create the ideal musical tissue for JessicaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s musical perceptions; her moving and gentle voice carries words of passion and unstableness.\nTheir songs are the perfect synthesis of their alchemic union.\nThe album might be considered a collection of visions or simply a concept on love and his facets.\nThe harmonies and the continual dialogue between voice and music produce a very original sound.\nLa Blanche Alchimie had a remarkable success during their live shows, and they have the ability to bring to life the romantic and decaying atmospheres interweaved in their songs .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e2692bc7e8a0c3e9e6de98908f576cc25be31c5","amp;dn":"La+Blanche+Alchimie+-+La+Blanche+Alchimie+%5B2009%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e2692bc7e8a0c3e9e6de98908f576cc25be31c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,38,146,188,126,138,12,62,158,109,233,137,8,245,118,204,37,190,49,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
