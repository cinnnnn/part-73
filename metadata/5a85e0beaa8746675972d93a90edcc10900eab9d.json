Your organization\n       can start using and benefiting from these features right away!\n\n       Intuitive User Interface that Automatically ?Learns? and\n       ?Remembers? Passwords\n\n       Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ There is only one password to remember. All of your employees?\n         passwords are protected using a ?Master Password?. So they\n         remember one Master Password, and RoboForm Enterprise remembers\n         the rest.\n       Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ When a user enters a new password, RoboForm Enterprise simply\n         prompts to save and store this new password for the employee\n         and subsequently logs them in automatically.\n       Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Originally built for consumers and used by millions of users\n         worldwide, the software is extremely user friendly and designed\n         to simplify password management to meet the needs of the most\n         novice user. Users can be up and running quickly with little to\n         no training required.\n\n\n       Powerful Password Protection\n\n       Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Stores employee passwords in encrypted ?Passcards? using\n         industry-standard AES encryption with a single, Master Password\n         as a key.\n       Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Master Password protected on the client and known only to\n         employee, keeping it confidential and secured from outsiders.\n       Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Offers a ?dual master password? capability that allows managers\n         or IT staff to share credentials for accessing applications\n         with other employees, without sharing the actual\n         username/password.\n       Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Offers a secure password generator to help you increase\n         password security, allowing you to create and enforce more\n         complex passwords enterprise-wide. Automatically generates\n         secure, randomized passwords without burdening employees.\n\n\n       Flexible, Enterprise-Wide Implementation and Administration\n\n       Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Automates installation for fast, non-disruptive, mass rollout\n         across the enterprise.\n       Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Allows for offline RoboForm Enterprise activation.\n       Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Is compatible with most automated software install programs,\n         making it as easy to install on 1,000 computers as it is on\n         one.\n       Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Using centralized policy editor, allows you to easily customize\n         user access to every option and feature available in RoboForm\n         Enterprise, by showing/hiding functionality.\n\n\n       Easy and Seamless Integration\n\n       Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Requires no up-front integration effort or no team of\n         consultants to plan, integrate, or make changes to your\n         existing application infrastructure, saving significant time\n         and development costs (that would be required of traditional\n         SSO solutions).\n       Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Eliminates the need for your implementation staff to collect\n         and store user credentials, determine login resources or\n         enforce password standards enterprise-wide since RoboForm\n         Enterprise does this automatically.\n       Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Continues to work as systems evolve automatically, with no\n         additional integration work or infrastructure changes required.\n       Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Relies on existing mechanisms, i.e., securely stores and\n         ?remembers? usernames and passwords, thus, eliminating the need\n         to change user profiles or applications.\n       Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Supports virtually all the business applications your employees\n         need to access including legacy systems.\n       Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Supports integration into multiple environments. Any user,\n         employee, partner, or other stakeholder can benefit whether\n         they use 3rd party applications and systems.\n       Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Once configured, allows for secure remote access, on and\n         off-network for mobile employees.\n\n\n       Conforms to Strict Company Password Standards, Policies and Other\n       Authentication Methods\n\n       RoboForm Enterprise helps you to ensure stronger password\n       management practices and policies without increasing IT costs.\n\n       Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Supports your company?s particular standards for strong\n         passwords, biometric authentication, fingerprint\n         authentication, application access and deny lists, etc.\n       Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ By using the convenient, centralized Policy Editor, lets you\n         quickly customize and enforce enterprise policies for password\n         requirements including password length and complexity, password\n         re-sets/expiration, white-listed or black-listed Web sites,\n         etc. The Policy Editor is so easy to use, you can customize\n         every feature in RoboForm Enterprise in less than 30 minutes!\n\n\n       Highly Robust and Scalable Solution\n\n      Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Scales up to support many thousands of users. Because it was\n         originally designed as a consumer-based product back in 1999,\n         RoboForm Enterprise has been effectively field-tested by\n         millions of users with tens of millions of usernames and\n         passwords.\n\n\n       Secure, Distributed Architecture with No Single Point of Attack\n\n       Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Is installed on individual clients, which makes the application\n         highly available. As long as the client is working and\n         applications to which the user needs to login are available,\n         the software is operational.\n       Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Encrypts and stores each employees? Passcards on individual\n         clients, ensuring that no ?keys to the kingdom? are available\n         for phishers, keyloggers or hackers to compromise an\n         enterprise?s password storehouse.\n\n\n       Advanced Identity Theft and Fraud Protection\n\n       Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Fights ?Phishing? by linking sensitive login information only\n         to the correct URL. RoboForm Enterprise will only recognize\n         valid URLs that are associated with login information. A fake\n         site would not be recognized and therefore login information\n         would not be provided automatically.\n       Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Defeats Keyloggers. RoboForm Enterprise does not require using\n         a keyboard to type passwords. RoboForm Enterprise offers the\n         option of a Virtual Keyboard to &quot;type&quot; the Master Password; and\n         keyloggers cannot detect it. The Virtual Keyboard is an image\n         of a keyboard on the screen in which users click the images of\n         the keyboard buttons. Since there are no keystrokes, there's\n         nothing for the keylogger to detect or transmit.\n\n\n      Portability\n\n       Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ A portable version, RoboForm2Go, is available to run from a USB\n         Flash Drive. This version allows your employees to securely\n         take their passwords, contacts and bookmarks with them.\n       Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Ensures that employees access Web site applications securely,\n         even from unsecured public computers.\n\n\n\n       Whats New in Version 7.9.6 -- Apr 11, 2014\n\n       * Chrome: Fix clicking Chrome checkbox on RF Options -&gt; Browser\n         Integration page has no effect.\n       * Chrome: Fix RF does not install Chrome adapter if RF is\n         installed for current user only.\n       * Chromium-based browsers: register RF Chrome Native Messaging\n         host, to work without Chrome.\n       * Add FireFox-based Telekom Browser 7 to the list of supported\n         browsers.\n       * Win32: make RoboForm attach to WindowsForms app Amerigo.exe.\n       * Win32: fix rarecrashes in RF implementation of MS\n         Accessibility.\n       * Fix 'Activate' link in RF Trial Pro dialog.\n       * AutoSave bar: fix content layout of the Details dropdown\n         window.\n       * UI: Fix only a tail part of text may appear in edit boxes on\n         non-dialog based windows.\n       * UI: Fix RF toolbar popup windows and dialogs looks ugly if\n         Windows is set to high DPI mode.\n\n\n\n\n       For a full listing of AI Roboform Enterprise's capabilities visit:\n      &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.roboform.com/enterprise/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.roboform.com/enterprise/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n       Windows XP/Vista/7/8\n\n\n\n\n\n[INSTALLATION NOTES]\n\n\n       As of 09/14/2013 ALL TE RAR archives will now be using the RAR5\n       standard.  Please make sure to update to the latest version of\n       Winrar (at least Winrar v5.0) so you can extract the contents of\n       the *.001, *.002 etc...\n       The update is free, there is no reason not to update.\n\n       Install AiRoboForm-Enterprise.exe.  After installation make\n       sure all Internet Explorer and/or other browsers and explorer\n       windows are closed or else the file(s) will not copy over\n       properly (as well as the Roboform Taskbar Icon).  Reboot into\n       safe mode if you still have problems.  Copy roboform.dll and\n       roboform-x64.dll (x64 dll is only needed for IE 64bit!) into AI\n       Roboform's installed folder, making sure to overwrite the\n       existing files.  AI Roboform is now in the full PRO version with\n       Enterprise features.\n\n       Included is the Enterprise policies tool with this release so you\n       don't need to request it from the homepage.  Its located in the\n       PolicyEditor folder.\n\n       Feel free to use the online sync feature, it does work fine when\n       you run the setup.  Also make sure to set it up later or a\n       taskbar notification will let you know once.  This is also known\n       as RoboForm Everywhere which is fully functional in this release.\n       In IE 64bit it may show as Desktop ONLY in the about window, but\n       if you have chosen Everywhere syncing is still performed\n       (hopefully fixed in an update).  Its suggested to use a different\n       RoboForm Everywhere password than your master password.  This way\n       nobody will be able to decrypt your online database except you.\n\n       Note that you can now choose either Everywhere or Desktop type of\n       installation while first installing AI Roboform.  You can also\n       tell which type of configuration its currently set at by opening\n       the About window from the taskbar icon, keep this running if you\n       want full time syncing with Everywhere.  Everywhere will show\n       Sync With [USERNAME], while Desktop will not show Sync.  This can\n       be changed at any time by going into Options then User Data and\n       clicking on Settings button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it! Done.\n\n                            Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Supp0rt th3 D3v3lop3r if you liK3 it.\n\n                        3Nj0Y!!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a85e0beaa8746675972d93a90edcc10900eab9d","amp;dn":"AI+Roboform+Enterprise+v7.9.6.7-TE+%5Bdeepstatus%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a85e0beaa8746675972d93a90edcc10900eab9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,133,224,190,170,135,70,103,89,114,217,58,144,237,204,16,144,14,171,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
