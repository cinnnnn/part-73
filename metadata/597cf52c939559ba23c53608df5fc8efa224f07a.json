The film is based on a play by George S. Kaufman and Alexander Woollcott and stars Edward G. Robinson and Mary Astor. Our overall rating for this film is: good. \n\nWhen his sister falls under the sadistic spell of her Svengali-like sadistic husband, acclaimed stage star Damon Wells (Edward G. Robinson) decides heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll do whatever it takes to save her. \n\nWhat it takes is murder. And what it takes to get away with murder is a perfect disguise created out of greasepaint, false whiskers and a brilliant actorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s skill. \n\nHeading a top cast that includes Mary Astor, Ricardo Cortez and Louis Calhern, Robinson is marvelous wearing either of his two faces in this clever thriller based on a popular play by George S. Kaufman and Alexander Woollcott. \n\nA special treat: the surprising (and satisfying) ending, unorthodox for a movie made in the Production Code era.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 927mb\nDuration.... 01:12:32\nCodec.... divx\nFrame Width..... 640\nFrame Height.... 480\nData Rate.... 1659kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 128kbps\n1 Channel mono\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:597cf52c939559ba23c53608df5fc8efa224f07a","amp;dn":"The+Man+with+Two+Faces+1934+DvdRip+Avi+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"597cf52c939559ba23c53608df5fc8efa224f07a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,124,245,44,147,149,89,186,35,197,54,8,223,95,200,239,162,36,240,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
