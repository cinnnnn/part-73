They wanted to start a new one. Formed in Marylebone, London in 1997, they printed their own Fries currency in tribute to Abbie Hoffman, sought independent nation status from the Pope and Bill Clinton and set about detonating a dreary music scene by creating a space-rock party band with on anti-establishment streak a mile wide. Levitating the White House, The Taj Mahal and the Pyramids simultaneously was their mission, and they took it seriously.\nThey didn't have fans; they had their own private army called the &quot;Fries Space Military&quot;. They didn't play gigs, they threw parties. Amidst it all, the music. At times megaton-heavy, at others catatonic, it was laced with vocals which read like galactic graffiti quoted by a passing astronaut. Time tunnels to Ancient Egypt (Afrika Take Me Back); sleeping gas and Zambian Moon-shots (Vitamin X) ; Edward Lear-ish lysergic poetry (farewell to arms &quot;Supposed To Be A Gas&quot;). Anything went but sense. That was when you could hear Dave singing them. An eight piece plus backing tapes, The Fries live were twice as loud as most. bands. But that was barely the beginning of their surrealist cavalcade. Burning incense, acres of camouflage netting, six foot &quot;FRIeS' letters and banks of TVs beaming out Japanese erotica and punk graphics gave the impression The Fries had teleported in from some bizarre rock'n`roll army mess in deep space. Percussion meant Rich rattling a vintage birdcage covered in stolen hotel keys. No wonder they caused a stir in a world still waiting for Brit-pop to turn experimental. Fuelled on a reputation for chaos the band scored Radio One and NME Singles Of The Week with the explosive &quot;Dust it&quot; before they'd even played a gig. Within six months they'd signed to JBON2 on a rooftop overlooking the Thames for a five album deal . Naturally, they used black quilled pens to do it. DÃƒÂ©but album &quot;Accept The Signal&quot; was duly heralded by an expectant music press. Rolling Stone announced: the Fries fuse sixties psychedelic), punk attitude and acid house spirit to dazzling effect&quot;. The NME added &quot;few bands ever get as trippy or as disconnected from reality as The Regular Fries. They are to be saluted on sight&quot;. Loaded cut to the chase when they declared simply, &quot;The Regular Fries are the greatest rock'n'roll band in the world&quot;.\nWith the group waging war on reality with each passing day, they flew to New York to record second album &quot;War On Plastic Plants&quot; with producer Dave Friddman. Conceived as a &quot;millenial jukebox&quot;; the album started with a hidden track featuring a crazed South American dictator and got progressively weird from there. A bizarre mix of free jazz; glam rock and their trademark sleaze-funk, it reaffirmed their impeccable cult credentials. Kindred spirits flocked to the cause and Space Military Units formed as far afield as Oslo, Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur.\nIt couldn't last. With debts rising into the hundreds of thousands due mainly to Dave's habit of lighting distress flares on stage, The Fries unveiled plans to fill venues with sand and recreate the spirit of the Colosseum. Their accountants were not impressed. With their label in meltdown, the band recorded final album &quot;Blueprint For A Higher Civilisation&quot; in a week and released a message to the press saying they had exited the Solar System for a tour of the Vega Constellation. Ominously, their &quot;Mars Hotel&quot; website (www.regularfries.net) put up a &quot;No Vacancies&quot; sign the same week.\n&quot;We hate the charts and the charts hate us.&quot; said Paul Moody in 2001 during chaotic sessions in London for their final ever recording &quot;Vitamin X&quot;. &quot;We're off into the cosmos!&quot; The party was over. England's strangest, most surreal band for a generation had left Earth orbit ...\nDavid Creek Editor, The Cult Music Bible, San Francisco.
