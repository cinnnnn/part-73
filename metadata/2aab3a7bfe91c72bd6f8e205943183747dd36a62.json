The film followed a young policeman (Salah Kabil) trying to unearth government corruption while dealing with looking for his father, as well as his half-brother (Ali El Scherif), an incendiary journalist and soldier trying to affect change on the homefront while dealing with corruption on his own. Describing it this way makes it seem like more of a simplistic propaganda piece, but the film is nuanced and complex, replete with subplots including a local sheik (Mahmoud El-Meliguy) miffed at his overprotection, the search for a Keyser Soze-like local crimelord, and the strong woman (Mohsena Tewfik) whose residence much of the film revolves around, and who progressively becomes the focus as the climax rises and Gamal Nasser Hussein's Egypt crumbles.\n\nUntouched PAL DVD\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068225/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068225/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: Arabic\nSubtitles: French\n\nAl-asfour AKA The Sparrow AKA Le moineau (1972)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2aab3a7bfe91c72bd6f8e205943183747dd36a62","amp;dn":"Al-asfour+AKA+The+Sparrow+AKA+Le+moineau+%281972%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2aab3a7bfe91c72bd6f8e205943183747dd36a62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,171,58,123,254,145,199,43,214,248,226,5,148,49,131,116,125,211,106,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
