As Kevin recovers from his injury, Shaun wins Gold. Now all Kevin wants to do is get on his snowboard again, even though medics and family fear this could kill him. We also celebrate Sarah Burke who crashed in Park City and died January 19, 2012.\n\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: French\n\nFor Newer Users.\nSimply Drag downloaded folder to your Media Player.
