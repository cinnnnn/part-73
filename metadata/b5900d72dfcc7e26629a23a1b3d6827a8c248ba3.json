The second part was completed in 1964 with the assistance of Wan Chaochen and Wan Dihuan. Both parts of the film were screened together for the first time in 1965.\n\nBoth historically and artistically this should be considered an important movie in Chinese animation. Today when we think of foreign animation, many will probably just think of Anime (Japanese animation). But this movie affords a glimpse back to a time before the Cultural Revolution dealt Chinese animation a serious blow from which it (arguably) never recovered.\n\nAnd it is simply a fun story with some beautiful animation! It certainly deserves a proper DVD release. Hence this FAN RESTORATION. Hopefully a proper restoration will be done at some point in the future, until then this is probably the best you're gonna get...\n\n\nVIDEO\n\nBasically two versions of this movie exits:\nThe theatrical version, which has been released on vhs and on a Chinese bootleg dvd. This is also the version you might have seen on tv - it was aired in many European countries in the late seventies or early eighties.\n\nAnd the 40th Anniversary Edition, an official Chinese dvd released in 2004.\nIt appears to be an earlier generation/different version than the theatrical version, and features some differences in framing and colors. This is the only official dvd release of the movie.\n\nBoth sources, unfortunately, has several problems:\nThe 40th Anniversary ed. has a very jumpy image that needed to be stabilized. It shows a lot of dirt and image degradation, many scenes shows a color shift towards green or another color - in some cases the color information was too far gone to be repaired/corrected. Also it has the dreaded 'crushed blacks' which destroys the details in dark scenes. Many frames are bad or has annoying writing on them. In many places it shows some strange ghosting or blended frames (fortunately not very noticable in motion). And of course, most importantly, it is missing over 20 minutes of the movie.\nWhat is good about it is that it is sharper and more detailed than any other version, and when not too damaged, the colors are much more vibrant and colorful than ever seen before.\n\nThe theatrical bootleg DVD - like all theatrical versions, it is cropped differently, and the colors are rather different. More blue and red and lacking some yellow. This is a pretty poor transfer, rather soft and lacking detail, but it's the best I've found.\n\nThis version mainly uses the video from the 40th Anniversary ed., with footage cut in from the Chinese bootleg DVD when the former was unusable or missing. I've tried my best to match the two versions, but they are very different in look and quality.\n\nDirt and damage have been removed to the best of my abilities, including repairing MANY frames by hand. A few bad frames still remain, they were simply to time consuming to fix properly.\n\nThe entire movie has been color corrected. It is still not completely consistent unfortunately, due to the sometimes heavy damage to the colors.\n\n\nAUDIO\n\nAll the audio tracks was edited to sync with the restored version. Some light filtering was performed to unify the sound a bit and make the patches/edits less apparent. Also tried to tone down the sometimes very harsh sound.\n\nMandarin Chinese (stereo/mono)\nSimilarly to the video, the 40th Anniversary ed. audio was used where possible. The poorly faked 5.1 audio was converted back to stereo. This is the only known stereo source, so was preferred even though it has some weird artifacts in places. Audio from the Chinese bootleg DVD was spliced in where needed.\n\nEnglish Narration\nFrom a vhs recording of the tv-broadcast.\nUnknown narrator.\n\nFrench Dub\nFrom a digitized version of the original vhs.\nThis was recorded much too 'hot', so some distortion is inevitable in places. I've tried to restore some of the dynamics with an expander.\n\nDanish Narration\nFrom a vhs recording of the tv-broadcast.\nNarrator: Povl Dissing\n\nSwedish Narration\nFrom a digitized version of the original vhs.\nNarrator: Hans 'Hasse' Alfredsson\n\n\nSUBTITLES\n\nChinese Simplified\nTaken from the Chinese bootleg DVD, and synced to this version. A few lines are left untranscribed, and I couldn't say how accurate it is.\n\nChinese Traditional\nSimply converted from the above.\n\nEnglish Fansub\nThis is a slightly edited/modified version of the Duxty/foolip fansub that has been available for some time for the 40th Anniversary DVD. New translations of the re-inserted scenes was added.\n\nEnglish Alternate (default)\nAn alternate English translation based on the (bad) subtitles from the Taiwanese edition of the 40th Anniversary DVD, but very heavily edited and modified. Hardly a line has been left untouched.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5900d72dfcc7e26629a23a1b3d6827a8c248ba3","amp;dn":"Abekongen+%28Havoc+in+heaven%29+fan+restore","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5900d72dfcc7e26629a23a1b3d6827a8c248ba3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,144,13,114,223,204,126,38,98,154,35,161,179,214,130,122,140,36,139,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
