Rarely has a film been as honest about sexuality-in both depiction and discussion-as this tale of a one-night-stand that develops into a weekend-long idyll for two very different young men (exciting newcomers Tom Cullen and Chris New) in the English Midlands. It's an emotionally naked film that's both an invaluable snapshot of the complexities of contemporary gay living and a universally identifiable portrait of a love affair.\n\nMenus-Yes\nExtras-Yes\n\nSpecial Features including\nInterviews With Andrew Haigh, Pontikos, Producer Tristan Goligher, and Actors Tom Cullen and Chris New\nNew Interview With Andrew Haigh on the Film's Sex Scenes\nOn-Set Video Footage Shot By New And Others\nTwo Scenes From Cullen And New's Audition\nVideo Essay On The Film's Set Photographers, Oisin share And Colin Quinn\nCahuenga Blvd. and Five Miles Out, Two Short Films By Andrew Haigh\n\nLet's get this SEEDED people!!
