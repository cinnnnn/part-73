It ended in February/March 2014.\n\nThis class is an introduction to the modern extragalactic astronomy and cosmology, i.e., the part of astrophysics that deals with the structure and evolution of the universe as a whole, and its major constituents: dark matter, dark energy, galaxies, quasars, large-scale structure, and intergalactic gas.  It will cover the subjects including: relativistic cosmological models and their parameters, extragalactic distance scale, cosmological tests, composition of the universe, dark matter, and dark energy; the hot big bang, cosmic nucleosynthesis, recombination, and cosmic microwave background; formation and evolution of structure in the universe; galaxy clusters, large-scale structure and its evolution; galaxies, their properties and fundamental correlations; formation and evolution of galaxies; star formation history of the universe; quasars and other active galactic nuclei, and their evolution; structure and evolution of the intergalactic medium; diffuse extragalactic backgrounds; the first stars, galaxies, and the reionization era.  It corresponds to the Ay 21 class taught at Caltech.\n\nMore information about this course is available at https://coursera.org/course/cosmo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aacb43276e80eefbd0a92a4dc5d56fccb2c516f2","amp;dn":"%5BCoursera%5D+Galaxies+and+Cosmology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aacb43276e80eefbd0a92a4dc5d56fccb2c516f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,203,67,39,110,128,238,251,208,169,42,77,197,213,111,204,178,197,22,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
