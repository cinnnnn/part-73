The film, directed by GÃƒÂ©la Babluani (who also directed the original), stars Sam Riley, Ray Winstone, Curtis &quot;50 Cent&quot; Jackson, Mickey Rourke, and Jason Statham.\n\n\n\n\nVincent &quot;Vince&quot; Ferro overhears people talking about a dead man who was going to start a well-paid job. Ferro, in need of money, steals an envelope containing the instructions for the job. He arrives at an event in a secluded place. He is ordered to strip, and his boot heels are cut off, in order to check for surveillance equipment. The organizers accept him for the job instead of the dead man. The job is participation in a series of Russian roulette games. There are several participants, identified by number. In each round, the participants have to spin the cylinder of their revolver, and shoot when the light of a special light bulb is switched on. The event is organized for the enjoyment of rich spectators, one of these spectators being Jasper Bagges, who places bets on who will survive. Bagges bets on his brother Ronald, who was brought from the mental institution.\n\nIn the first round, the participants each get one bullet in their revolver, they are arranged into a circle, and each has to aim his revolver at the man in front of him. Ferro tries to back out, but he is forced to participate. As #13, he survives the first round and fires his gun only after being threatened with death. In the second round, in which two bullets are placed in each gun, Ferro survives only because the man behind him is killed before he could fire. In the third round, with three bullets in each gun, Ferro again survives, along with four other men. Ferro is one of two survivors randomly chosen to participate in a duel. The three others are finished and get a large sum of money. One of them, Patrick Jefferson was brought from prison, where he served a sentence, and is surprised that he is also free now, and he is escorted by Jimmy, one of the employees. Jimmy tries to kill him while he is changing clothes, but is interrupted by another of the men that work the event before he can finish trying to strangle him from behind.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fb1677b7170fd94354d78429b23ec26b9d62ee5","amp;dn":"13+%282010%29+DVD9+PAL+ENG+GER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fb1677b7170fd94354d78429b23ec26b9d62ee5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,177,103,123,113,112,253,148,53,77,120,66,155,35,236,38,185,214,46,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
