If you like to use it as multiuser system it is recommended to start XDM login manager. Just type in terminal xdm-start and reboot. xdm-stop will reverse back autologin as root. \n\n Login details: \nroot with password root \npuppy with password puppy \n\n Two versions are available for download: \n 1. DebianDog-Porteus-jwm_icewm-beta.iso -112 Mb: \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://smokey01.com/saintless/DebianDog/DebianDog-Porteus-jwm_icewm-beta.iso&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://smokey01.com/saintless/DebianDog/DebianDog-Porteus-jwm_icewm-beta.iso&lt;/a&gt; \n\n Default WM - JWM with option to switch to IceWM. \n Default File Manager - XFE with option to use Rox. \n Default Internet Browser - Dillo. \n\n 2. DebianDog-Porteus-openbox_xfce-beta.iso - 150 Mb (from Fred): \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://smokey01.com/saintless/DebianDog/DebianDog-Porteus-openbox_xfce-beta.iso&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://smokey01.com/saintless/DebianDog/DebianDog-Porteus-openbox_xfce-beta.iso&lt;/a&gt; \n\n Default WM - OpenBox with XFCE. \n Default File Manager - Thunar with option to use Rox or XFE. \n Default Internet Browser - Iceweasel. \n\n md5sum check;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://smokey01.com/saintless/DebianDog/md5sum.txt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://smokey01.com/saintless/DebianDog/md5sum.txt&lt;/a&gt; \n\n DebianDog has kernel 3.2.0-4-486. If it works for your hardware you need nothing more. If it doesn't, please, read the third post how to boot easy with different kernel. \n\n We have 3 different initrd files included which gives 3 different boot and save file options. I will explain them proper in the next post. \n Please, read also Examples-boot-codes.txt for boot options: \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://smokey01.com/saintless/DebianDog/Examples-boot-codes.txt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://smokey01.com/saintless/DebianDog/Examples-boot-codes.txt&lt;/a&gt; \n\n After testing the boot methods and save file options and decide which one is best for you, just remove 2 initrd files to save 15 Mb space from the system. \n\n Both versions have a lot in common as boot and save file options. The difference is in the WM and applications choice. \n\n In post five on this page you will find information how to install packages in Debian with Synaptic (GUI) or apt-get (CLI). \n\n DebianDog has a lot of tools similar to Puppy. You can load puppy SFS modules and many of them will work out of the box. You can create easy separate sfs modules and remaster the system with all personal changes. I will give more information about the available tools in one of the next posts. \n\n I like to give my Thanks to Smokey for hosting DebianDog project, \n to Debian team for keeping Debian such flexible system, \n to this forum for the opportunity to work on a project different from puppy linux, \n to our forum members working on DebianDog development: Fred (fredx181), Terry (sunburnt), William (mcewanw), Sergey (sklimkin), \n and for the valuable advices to: jbv, sfs, catsezmoo, big_bass, emil, dancytron, anikin from our forum \n and dzz from www.debianuserforums.org \n And to Sickgut for his original idea that made possible DebianDog to exist. \n\n Toni\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43a7ee332c3fb98dbe28ccce3c3f197d2df54c53","amp;dn":"Puppy_Linux_DebianDog_archive_16-Apr-2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43a7ee332c3fb98dbe28ccce3c3f197d2df54c53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,167,238,51,44,63,185,141,190,40,204,206,60,63,25,125,45,245,76,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
