This was not one of his more significant units (few of the sidemen have been heard from much since) and the music, although more jazz-oriented than his earlier Columbia LPs (including versions of &quot;Take the 'A' Train&quot; and a vocal feature for MF on &quot;As Time Goes By&quot;), is not really that memorable. It's a lesser effort. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Admiral's Horn\n02 - Jar Star\n03 - Take The 'A' Train\n04 - Latino Lovewalk\n05 - Sesame Street\n06 - As Time Goes By\n07 - Go With The Flo\n08 - Hit In The Head\n\nSplit with Medieval. Sorry.\nEnjoy and share!
