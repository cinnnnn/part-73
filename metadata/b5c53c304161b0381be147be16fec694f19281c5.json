A Southern California atomplant is losing its top secrets and the FBI and Scotland Yard, in the respective persons of Dennis OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Keefe and Louis Hayward, join forces to run down the criminals. Action swings to San Francisco and back to the southland, punching hard all the time under the knowledgeable direction of Gordon Douglas. On-the-site filming of locales adds authenticity.\n\nMade at a time in America when the House Un-American Activities Committee was investigating the government and Hollywood for communist infiltrators, Walk a Crooked Mile (1948) presents an unnerving scenario featuring Russian spies and a major security breach within a top secret U.S. facility that played to the paranoia of audiences at the time. A low-budget programmer helmed by Gordon Douglas, who was still honing his craft at Warner Bros. as a B-movie workhorse, this brisk, efficient little entertainment not only worked as morale-building propaganda for the FBI and Scotland Yard but also had an immediacy that earlier crime dramas lacked due to its semi-documentary style.\n\nDirector Gordon Douglas drew on mounting anti-Communist hysteria to create one of the first Cold War filmsÃ¢â‚¬â€the tale of an FBI agent and a Scotland Yard detective who must bust a spy ring led by a ruthless agent working to infiltrate an atomic research facility. Producer Eddie Small stood tall in a battle against FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover to produce the film without interference, arguing the Bureau was fair game for fictionalization.But Hoover had the last word, writing The New York Times to say the FBI had not sanctioned the film,which in fact the FBI did sanction the film.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 1.33gb\nDuration.... 01:31:13\nCodec.... divx\nFrame Width..... 720\nFrame Height.... 540\nData Rate.... 1969kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23 F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 128kbps....
