The material on the album ranges from standards to contemporary classics like &quot;The Great Speckled Bird,&quot; and not a single cut on the record fails to raise the hairs on the back of your neck. In the late '50s, country gospel albums didn't come much finer than Dust on the Bible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b32a000cb69245c2d541209c81b1480863cbd685","amp;dn":"Kitty+Wells+-+Dust+On+The+Bible+%281959%29+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b32a000cb69245c2d541209c81b1480863cbd685","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,42,0,12,182,146,69,194,213,65,32,156,129,177,72,8,99,203,214,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
