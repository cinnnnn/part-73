We recommend that you reapply the software update after installing new add-on products to an existing COMSOL 4.4 installation. Update Details.\n\nImportant\n If you have a license for LiveLinkÃ¢â€žÂ¢ for InventorÃ‚Â®, click here for further update instructions. \n\n\nInstallation\n\nCheck your version\n\nMake sure that you run COMSOL version 4.4.0.150 or later. On the Help menu, click About COMSOL Multiphysics to check your version. If you have an earlier build number, contact your COMSOL sales representative to get the official release of COMSOL 4.4 before you proceed.\n\nDownload Update\n\nBullet  Windows  comsol_4.4.0.195_win.exe 57.8 MB \nBullet  Linux  comsol_4.4.0.195_linux.zip 85.5 MB \nBullet  Mac OS X  comsol_4.4.0.195_mac.dmg 57.9 MB \n\nIf you have a license for the MEMS Module, the Acoustics Module, or the Structural Mechanics Module, also download the additional update for these products\n\nBullet  Windows  comsol_4.4.0.195_piezo_win.exe 485 KB \nBullet  Linux  comsol_4.4.0.195_piezo_linux.zip 6 KB \nBullet  Mac OS X  comsol_4.4.0.195_piezo_mac.dmg 42 KB \n\n\nIf you have a license for LiveLinkÃ¢â€žÂ¢ for ExcelÃ‚Â®, download also the additional update for this product\n\nBullet  Windows  comsol_4.4.0.195_llexcel_win.exe 1.2 MB \n\n\nIf you have a license for LiveLinkÃ¢â€žÂ¢ for SolidWorksÃ‚Â®, download also the additional update for this product\n\nBullet  Windows  comsol_4.4.0.195_llsw_win.exe 1.3 MB \n\n \nIf you have a license for LiveLinkÃ¢â€žÂ¢ for InventorÃ‚Â®, download also the additional update for this product\n\nBullet  Windows  comsol_4.4.0.195_llinv_win.exe 994 KB \n\n\nFinish the installation of the update, then to complete the installation of LiveLinkÃ¢â€žÂ¢ for InventorÃ‚Â® follow these steps:\n1.Right-click the InventorÃ‚Â® icon and select Run as administrator.\n2.As the LiveLinkÃ¢â€žÂ¢ add-in is loaded it completes the update, and in a few moments you should see the following message: \nThe LiveLink for COMSOL (4.4) add-in has been updated. Please restart Inventor for the changes to take effect.\n\nThis is normally sufficient and you can safely close InventorÃ‚Â®. If you however do not see this message complete these additional steps:\n\n3.Click the Add-Ins button on the Tools tab in InventorÃ‚Â® to open the Add-Ins Manager dialog box.\n4.Click LiveLink for COMSOL (4.4) in the list of add-ins.\n5.Select the Loaded/Unloaded check box if it is not already selected.\n6.The add-in is now loaded, and it completes the update.
