Spoofing jungle movies, the trio finds itself in Darkest Africa in this 1941 jaunt. Politically incorrect from the titles on (look at the lips on those natives!), the film is a vast improvement over the earlier &quot;Road to Singapore&quot; (1940). The series peaked with the next two films, &quot;Road to Morocco&quot; and &quot;Road to Utopia,&quot; but continue on through &quot;Road to Hong Kong&quot; in the early 1960s.
