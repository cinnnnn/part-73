In search of a new start and the American dream, Ewa Cybulski and her sister Magda sail to New York from their native Poland. When they reach Ellis Island, doctors discover that Magda is ill, and the two women are separated. Ewa is released onto the mean streets of Manhattan while her sister is quarantined. Alone, with nowhere to turn and desperate to reunite with Magda, she quickly falls prey to Bruno, a charming but wicked man who takes her in and forces her into prostitution. And then one day, Ewa encounters Bruno's cousin, the debonair magician Orlando. He sweeps Ewa off her feet and quickly becomes her only chance to escape the nightmare in which she finds herself.\n\n\nLanguages: English / Polish\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English / French","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fecc64d6e3b48bfce754037d714ac0a8a1fa95b","amp;dn":"The+Immigrant+2013+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fecc64d6e3b48bfce754037d714ac0a8a1fa95b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,236,198,77,110,59,72,191,206,117,64,55,215,20,172,10,138,31,169,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
