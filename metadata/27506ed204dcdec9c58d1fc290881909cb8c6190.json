Perez left in the middle of the run but Wolfman wrote the whole volume. Contains issues 01-49 + the 4 annuals from this period. I have posted this first before Tales because it is in higher quality like the first volume, and by the same scanner groups; after issue 49 it becomes just the Teen Titans which I will post shortly. All thanks to TCR, bluejeff, and DCP for the scans, please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27506ed204dcdec9c58d1fc290881909cb8c6190","amp;dn":"The+New+Teen+Titans+v2+01-49+%2B+Ex+%281984-1988%7CC2C%7CTCR%2BDCP%2B%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27506ed204dcdec9c58d1fc290881909cb8c6190","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,80,110,210,4,220,222,201,197,141,31,194,144,136,25,9,203,140,97,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
