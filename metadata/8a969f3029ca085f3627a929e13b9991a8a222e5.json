Kamel (Rabah Ameur-Zaimeche) has been released from prison, and now it seems as if his only option is to return to Algeria. His cousin Bouzid (Abel Jafri) beaten to near death by a group of local teens who impose their belief on the frightened villagers, Kamel joins a small militia determined to put the violent thugs in their place. Later, when aspiring jazz chanteuse Louisa (Meriem Serbah) is shunned by her husband, who kidnaps the couple's son in fears that the boy will be exposed to her corruptive western values, Kamel and the abandoned young woman become bonded by their mutual outsider status. Their relationship is complicated, however, when Kamel sets out to confront the tyrannical teens and Louisa embarks on a frantic journey to re-connect with her missing son.\n\nRip Specs (DVD Rip)\n\nGeneral           : Bled number one.avi\nFormat            : AVI at 1 714 Kbps\nLength            : 1.16 GiB for 1h 37mn 5s 760ms\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 516 Kbps\nAspect            : 640 x 352 (1.818) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0795341/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0795341/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: French\nSubtitles: English, Portuguese\n\nRabah Ameur-Zaimeche - Bled Number One (2006)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a969f3029ca085f3627a929e13b9991a8a222e5","amp;dn":"Rabah+Ameur-Zaimeche+-+Bled+Number+One+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a969f3029ca085f3627a929e13b9991a8a222e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,150,159,48,41,202,8,95,54,39,169,41,225,59,153,145,168,162,34,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
