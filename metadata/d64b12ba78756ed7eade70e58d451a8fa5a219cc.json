The band ran off five gigs in seven days in late May 1997, and the jazz/rock/calypso fusion began. The successful May run was followed by a two-week trip up and down the East coast in December, and this run cemented Frogwings as a permanent part of the Allman Brothers Band sideshow.\n\nAfter rehearsing together for two weeks in late January of 1999, Frogwings hit the road with an inaugural gig at Lupo's Heartbreak Hotel in Providence, RI, supported by the Derek Trucks Band, with Derek pulling double duty all tour long. The entire tour was recorded for a live album, eventually entitled &quot;Croakin' At Toad's&quot;, released in late 2000.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d64b12ba78756ed7eade70e58d451a8fa5a219cc","amp;dn":"Frogwings+-+Croakin+at+Toads+-+Live+in+1999+++SBD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d64b12ba78756ed7eade70e58d451a8fa5a219cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,75,18,186,120,117,110,215,234,222,112,229,141,69,26,143,165,162,25,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
