The big band was still in prime form, playing both swing standards and originals with power, swing and spirit. In addition to Ferguson's screaming trumpet, altoist Lanny Morgan, Willie Maiden and Frank Vicari on tenors, baritonist Ronnie Cuber and pianist Mike Abene are heard from prominently while Abene, Maiden and Don Sebesky contribute most of the arrangements. This rare LP (which has not yet been reissued on CD) is worth the search. (AllMusic)\nWell, it seems that it has been reissued (in '94), so enjoy it.\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Chicago\n02 - Gravy Waltz\n03 - Cherokee\n04 - One O'clock Jump\n05 - Bossa Nova De Funk\n06 - Whisper Not\n07 - Take The A Train\n08 - At The Sound Of The Trumpet\n09 - Maine Bone\n10 - Watermelon Man\n11 - Danny Boy\n12 - Groove\n13 - Country Boy\n14 - We've Got A World That Swings\n15 - Naked City Theme\n16 - Blues For A Four String Quitar\n17 - I'm Getting Sentimental Over You\n18 - New Hope\n19 - Come Blow Your Horn\n20 - Antony And Cleopatra Theme\n\nSplit with Medieval. Sorry.\n\nEnjoy and share!
