But with only seasonal business and a cursed location, they hope to expand their brand so Nick can quit his construction work and focus solely on their hot dog business. Best friends Matt and Matt not only share the same name, but also share a passion for beignets which they hope to transform into a broader, successful culinary concept. These two teams will face off to prove that they have what it takes to win over the hungry residents of Traverse City, Mich.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 23-Feb-2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a466885b823e5d6034131570ba4c8a764b6c217","amp;dn":"Food.Court.Wars.S02E01.PDTV.x264-JIVE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a466885b823e5d6034131570ba4c8a764b6c217","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,70,104,133,184,35,229,214,3,65,49,87,11,164,200,167,100,182,194,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
