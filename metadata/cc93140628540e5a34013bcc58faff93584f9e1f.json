WILSON\nWhen Martin Williams, the director of the Jazz Program at the Smithsonian Institution, created a six-disk survey of recorded jazz in 1973, &quot;The Smithsonian Collection of Classic Jazz,&quot; he not only broke through the barriers that had prevented recordings controlled by one company from being mingled with those controlled by other companies and thus made possible really representative record collections, but, by his choice of selections and his annotations, he established a model for such overviews of an area of recorded music.\n\nIn that collection, the records were chosen either because of their excellence as performances or because they were representative of some aspect of an artist's work. The Smithsonian's latest historical collection, &quot;American Popular Song&quot; (by mail from Smithsonian Recordings, P.O. Box 23345, Washington, D. C. 20026; $47.96, plus $2.89 for mailing) is subtitled &quot;Six Decades of Songwriters and Singers,&quot; and it is concerned with more than recorded performances. It is, in effect, an illustrated variant of Alec Wilder's ground-breaking study, &quot;American Popular Song,&quot; in which Mr. Wilder analyzed the work of American songwriters from 1885 to 1950. The recorded collection, which includes a background and analysis of each song by James R. Morris and comment on the recorded performances, not only points up changes in the styles of popular songs but also follows the parallel developments in pop singing.\n\nBecause it is dependent on the availability of recordings, it begins not at the end of the 19th century, as Mr. Wilder did, but in 1911 with Sophie Tucker's first recording of &quot;Some of These Days,&quot; a song that had been written a year earlier. It continues, decade by decade (but skipping the 1970's) to Barbara Cook's 1980 recording of &quot;Some Other Time,&quot; a song that by then was 36 years old.\n\nA provocative relationship between songwriting and singing and, possibly, recording techniques is suggested by the fact that almost half the songs in the collection - 52 out of 110 - are represented by records made in the 1950's, but the decade that produced the greatest number of chosen songs was the 1930's. Until the 1940's, songs are usually represented by contemporary recordings. But from 1940 on, the recordings are predominantly of songs from a decade or more earlier.\n\nBecause the primary emphasis is on the songwriters and the writing of songs, a basic criterion in the choice of recordings by the three men who put the project together - Mr. Morris, J. R. Taylor and Dwight Blocker Bowers - was adherence to the composer's intentions. Thus, jazz singers, who normally create variations on a melody, are largely absent (Billie Holiday has only two entries and Louis Armstrong has one; Anita O'Day has none, but Ella Fitzgerald, singing songs by Rodgers &amp; Hart, the Gershwins, Jerome Kern, Cole Porter and Harold Arlen, has five).\n\nThe singer whose recordings have met the standards for inclusion most successfully is Fred Astaire, who first appears in 1926 with his sister Adele singing &quot;Fascinatin' Rhythm&quot; with George Gershwin at the piano. He was then still projecting in theatrical style with only a dim indication of the reedy voice that, with his cultivation of microphone technique, would charm listeners in the 30's and 40's. Mr. Astaire makes nine appearances in the set between 1926 and 1959, most of them concentrated in the 30's and 40's and always with marvelous songs.\n\nThat is a wide enough time span to indicate his development as a singer. Of the other singers in the collection, only Judy Garland, Nat King Cole and Frank Sinatra, each with five entries, are heard over a sufficient period of time to indicate changes in their performing styles. In more general terms, the set points up changes in public taste as the formality and prim precision of late 19th-century singers (still dominant in a 1915 recording by Grace Kerns and Reed Miller of Jerome Kern's &quot;They Didn't Believe Me&quot; and even in Billy Murray's jaunty performance in the same year of Irving Berlin's rhythmic &quot;I Love a Piano&quot;) gives way to a more informal vernacular style. Al Jolson's 1921 recording of &quot;April Showers&quot; has a bit of both - initially very florid in his projection of rolling r's to reach the last row of the balcony but loosening up as he moves in to target the individual listener.\n\nEven with relatively primitive acoustical recording equipment, Sophie Tucker was in the vanguard of the new era in 1911. Three recordings by Marion Harris between 1918 and 1927 defined the natural, conversational qualities of the new singing, first in her 1918 recording of a new song of that year, &quot;After You've Gone,&quot; and later showing the enhancement brought to the new style by electrical recording in the mid-20's in her 1927 record of &quot;The Man I Love.&quot; Miss Harris, as her entries show, was a perceptive and polished pioneer of the basic pop singing style that dominated the first half of this century.\n\nThe collection is, as one would expect, studded with classic performances, including Ethel Waters's &quot;I Can't Give You Anything But Love&quot; backed by Duke Ellington's orchestra and highlighted by her delightful imitation of Louis Armstrong; Billie Holiday's incredibly warm and intimate &quot;You Go To My Head&quot;; Nat Cole's &quot;Embraceable You&quot; and &quot;Lush Life&quot;; Judy Garland's &quot;Boy Next Door&quot; and &quot;Man That Got Away&quot;; Ella Fitzgerald's &quot;Blues In The Night&quot; and &quot;I'm Old Fashioned&quot;; Carmen McRae's &quot;Baltimore Oriole&quot;; Frank Sinatra's &quot;Here's That Rainy Day&quot; and practically the entire Fred Astaire repertory.\n\nThere are a couple of surprising moments - when Bessie Smith, singing &quot;Alexander's Ragtime Band&quot; in 1927, seems to take on the mannerisms of Pearl Bailey in the 1950's, and Sarah Vaughan's &quot;Lazy Afternoon,&quot; which has the tone and delivery of a very different singer, Mabel Mercer.\n\nInevitably, some of the performances chosen are rather routine, which is understandable when the primary point is the song rather than the singer. But to have &quot;I Got It Bad,&quot; sung by Ivie Anderson with Duke Ellington's orchestra, represented by the thin, harsh soundtrack of a &quot;Soundie,&quot; a musical film made for jukeboxes in 1941, simply because moralists had shifted a few of the original words in the excellent recording of the song that Miss Anderson and Mr. Ellington made for RCA Victor, seems to be carrying authenticity to self- defeating ends. And despite the very strong merits of Frank Sinatra's &quot;September Song,&quot; it would seem more consistent with the aim of being &quot;true to the composer's intention&quot; to have selected the memorable recording of that song by Walter Huston to whose vocal limitations the song was specifically tailored.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc93140628540e5a34013bcc58faff93584f9e1f","amp;dn":"American+Popular+Song+-+Six+Decades+Of+Songwriters+%26amp%3B+Singers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc93140628540e5a34013bcc58faff93584f9e1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,147,20,6,40,84,14,90,52,1,59,204,88,250,255,147,88,79,158,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
