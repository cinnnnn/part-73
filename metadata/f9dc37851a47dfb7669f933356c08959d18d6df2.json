As Tony Montana (in an alternate-ending story concept that follows the events of the original movie classic), players will travel through the steamy, often violent streets of Miami, the irie islands of the Florida Keys, the Bahamas and various other locales and will interact with a world full of seedy and dangerous characters to procure information, negotiate business deals, smuggle contraband and avoid rivals and DEA on a mission to rebuild their fallen empire.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9dc37851a47dfb7669f933356c08959d18d6df2","amp;dn":"Scarface%3A+The+World+is+Yours+%28PS2%29+%28PAL%29+%28Fabio5ilva%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9dc37851a47dfb7669f933356c08959d18d6df2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,220,55,133,26,71,223,183,102,159,147,51,86,192,137,89,209,141,109,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
