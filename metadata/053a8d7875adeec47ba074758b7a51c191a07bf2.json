The bandana masking one of the robbers slips and he is killed by the gang-leader Velvet Clark. The latter masquerades as a respectable piano-playing citizen of the community. The townspeople are aroused enough over the continued robberies that they ask Sheriff Tom Jones to resign but they agree to give him more time when he takes on Ryan as a deputy. Circumstantial evidence leads the sheriff to Clark, but the latter kills him and escapes. Ryan tracks him to Gunsight Ridge where there is a showdown gunfight\n\nSinopse Pt Br:\n\nEm uma pequena cidade do Arizona, um fora da lei se passa por um homem de posses e, sob esse disfarce, realiza diversos crimes. O novo xerife do local precisa desvendar esse mistÃƒÂ©rio o quanto antes para restabelecer a ordem na cidade.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:053a8d7875adeec47ba074758b7a51c191a07bf2","amp;dn":"Gunsight+Ridge+%5BJoel+McCrea%5D+%281957%29+TVRip+Oldies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"053a8d7875adeec47ba074758b7a51c191a07bf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,58,141,120,117,173,238,196,123,160,116,117,139,122,81,193,145,160,123,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
