And no one ever dies.\n\nExcept...\nThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a price to pay for paradise. Every fourth year, the strange power that fuels the town exacts its payment by infecting teens with deadly urges. In a normal year in Gardnerville, teens might stop talking to their best friends. In a fourth year, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d kill them.\n\nFour years ago, SkylarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sister, Piper, was locked away after leading sixteen of her classmates to a watery grave. Since then, Skylar has lived in a numb haze, struggling to forget her past and dull the pain of losing her sister. \n\nBut the secrets and memories Piper left behind keep taunting SkylarÃ¢â‚¬â€whispering that the only way to get her sister back is to stop GardnervilleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s murderous cycle once and for all.(\n\nGenre: Young Adult/ Fantasy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c67814f224b2c0b9cf562d4eda1acca7fbf17664","amp;dn":"%28Don%27t+You%29+Forget+About+Me+by+Kate+Karyus+Quin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c67814f224b2c0b9cf562d4eda1acca7fbf17664","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,120,20,242,36,178,192,185,207,86,45,78,218,26,204,167,251,241,118,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
