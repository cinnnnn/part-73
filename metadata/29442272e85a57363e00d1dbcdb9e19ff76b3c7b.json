It was released on November 5, 2001 by Jive Records. Looking to transition from the teen pop styles of her earlier albums ...Baby One More Time (1999) and Oops!... I Did It Again (2000), Spears began to embrace a maturer sound with her next studio effort. Its music incorporates elements of pop with dance-pop and R&amp;B influences; its lyrics address the subjects of reaching adulthood and sexuality.[1] Contributions to its production came from a variety of collaborators, including Max Martin and Rami Yacoub.[2] Spears herself assumed a more prominent role in the album's development, co-writing five of its tracks. The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 745,000 copies. Its success made Spears the first female artist to have her first three albums debut atop the chart, a record she would later break again with her fourth record In the Zone (2003). To promote the album, Spears embarked on the Dream Within a Dream Tour, which began in November 2001 and continued through July 2002. The album received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29442272e85a57363e00d1dbcdb9e19ff76b3c7b","amp;dn":"Britney+Spears+-+Britney+%28CD+Rip%29+MusicFanatic98","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29442272e85a57363e00d1dbcdb9e19ff76b3c7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,68,34,114,232,90,87,54,62,0,209,219,205,185,225,159,247,107,60,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
