This is the first Zenwalk Live version that is NOT using an Aufs-enabled kernel but instead running Unionfs in userspace via FUSE on an unmodified Slackware generic kernel. It will also be probably the last Zenwalk Live version supporting 32-bit systems and it's going to be very likely the last Zenwalk Live edition that I contribute to the Zenwalk project. Same as in Zenwalk Live 7.2 I decided to feature PAE for supporting more than 4 GB RAM on 32-bit systems, but as a downside Zenwalk Live will not run on Pentium M (which lacks PAE support)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b826480bf5a9f884eb335df5e5bafe8a71b7ebf1","amp;dn":"Zenwalk+Linux+7.4+Live","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b826480bf5a9f884eb335df5e5bafe8a71b7ebf1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,38,72,11,245,169,248,132,235,51,93,245,229,186,254,138,113,183,235,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
