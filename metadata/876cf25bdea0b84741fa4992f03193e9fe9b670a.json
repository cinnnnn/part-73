They tried to get attention from big labels but this never happend. They wanted him to sound like Blood Sweat &amp; Tears. But this was not Greg's idea of music. The music has everything you need, like a wild version of early Moby Grape combined with New Dawn and C.A. Quintet, sometimes dreamy sometimes totally wild underground-psych, with female vocals and splattering leads, Titanic horns &amp; destorted guitars. Sweet tunes turn into dark psychpower. TOTALLY STONED!! \n\nSuper rare US psych concept album that has a Neighbr'hood Childr'n feel. This psych beauty, sometimes dreamy sometimes totally wild has female vocals, titanic horns &amp; distorted guitars. Sweet tunes turn into dark psych-power. Greg Ruban, the composer and front-man of Victoria recorded this album just before he had to go to Vietnam. When he returned from War, obviously mentally fucked, he took his unreleased album on a 3 month trip to Europe on a motorbike to promote it, but unfortunately that did not work out at all. The album was unreleased until only a few years ago.Ã¢â‚¬Â¦","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:876cf25bdea0b84741fa4992f03193e9fe9b670a","amp;dn":"Victoria+-+Victoria+%281971%29+224k","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"876cf25bdea0b84741fa4992f03193e9fe9b670a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,108,242,91,222,160,184,71,65,250,73,146,240,49,147,233,254,155,103,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
