The film is based on a play by Geza Herczeg, Karl Farkas and Robert Katscher and stars Al Jolson, Kay Francis, Dolores del Rio and Ricardo Cortez and Dick Powell. It is a First National Pictures production. \n\nMarch 1, 1934\nTHE SCREEN; Al Jolson, Kay Francis and Dolores Del Rio in a Pictorial Version of the Play, &quot;Wonder Bar.&quot;\nBy MORDAUNT HALL.\n\nAl Jolson's latest film is an adaptation of &quot;Wonder Bar,&quot; which, in its stage form, was described by its producers as a &quot;Continental novelty of European night life.&quot; The picture, which is now at the Warners' Strand, tells of the frolics, romances and the tragedies of one night in a Montmartre cabaret known as the Wonder Bar. It is set forth in much the same manner as &quot;Grand Hotel,&quot; but the studio experts see fit to emphasize here the cabaret show, touching, when it suits them, on the mirthful or melodramatic phases of the narrative.\n\n&quot;Wonder Bar&quot; thus depends more upon melody and elaborate staging than it does on its story. Busby Berkeley gives several striking dance groupings and besides this angle of the film there is a series of settings that serve as the background for Mr. Jolson's song, &quot;Goin' to Heaven on a Mule,&quot; which is rendered by the popular entertainer in black-face. There is a conception of Heaven, with a black St. Peter, a black Archangel Gabriel and black angels. There are several amusing features to this section of the film, including the idea of having a &quot;Chute to Hell,&quot; a board on which is registered the number of persons in the Celestial regions and in Hades, and wings on both Mr. Jolson and his mule. Heaven, as viewed from the outside, is a jumble of modernistic structures leaning in all directions, with a tremendously high and exceptionally narrow entrance.\n\nIt is scarcely fair to make comparisons between this production and other musical pictures. Suffice it to say that those who are partial to this type of entertainment will probably relish &quot;Wonder Bar,&quot; especially during those interludes where Mr. Jolson lifts his voice to vehement singing.\n\nThis offering can also boast of its string of players. Besides the zealous Mr. Jolson, there is Ricardo Cortez, as the villain; Dolores Del Rio, as Mr. Cortez's dancing partner and inamorata; Kay Francis as the faithless wife of a banker; Dick Powell, as a popular crooner, whose heart palpitates at the sight of Miss Del Rio; Guy Kibbee and Hugh Herbert, as two Americans who finally decide that it ought to be a capital offence for husbands to bring their wives to Paris; Robert Barrat, who is having his last fling at life, and several others. As for Mr. Jolson he is the well known Al Wonder, owner and entertainer of the renowned Wonder Bar. And he is also infatuated with Miss Del Rio.\n\nAmong the songs are &quot;Don't Say Good Night&quot; and &quot;Why Do I Dream Those Dreams?&quot; which are sung by Dick Powell, and Mr. Jolson sings &quot;Vive La France&quot; and &quot;Wonder Bar&quot; as well as &quot;Goin' to Heaven on a Mule.&quot;\n\nSeveral of the characters are introduced before they reach the Wonder Bar. Then the doorman of the famous Montmartre resort rolls out the sidewalk carpet for the arrivals and in a closing flash this same man, in the wee small hours, rolls up the carpet and the Wonder Bar's lights are switched off. Day has almost begun.\n\nWONDER BAR, an adaptation of the play by Geza Herczeg, Karl Farkas and Robert Katscher; music and lyrics by Harry Warren and Al Dubin; directed by Lloyd Bacon; a First National production. At the Strand.\n \nWonder Bar is a sterling example of Classical Hollywood cinemaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s late, Ã¢â‚¬Ëœdecadent,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ so-called Pre-Code phase which occurred in the short run-up to the stricter imposition of a revised and strengthened Production Code in July 1934.\n\nAccording to sources,Warner Bros. submitted an incomplete version of the film to the MPPDA, assuring the officials that the missing footage &quot;contained nothing to worry about.&quot; The completed print, however, contained a scene where an effeminate man cut in on a dancing couple and danced away with the man. Despite pressure from Joseph I. Breen, Public Relations Director of the MPPDA, Warner Bros. refused to eliminate the footage.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 3.31gb\nDuration.... 01:20:49\nVideo Tracks...
