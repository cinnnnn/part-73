Then, to her amazement, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“coolest girl in the worldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ moves in across the street and wants to be her friend. Tully Hart seems to have it all---beauty, brains, ambition. On the surface they are as opposite as two people can be: Kate, doomed to be forever uncool, with a loving family who mortifies her at every turn. Tully, steeped in glamour and mystery, but with a secret that is destroying her. They make a pact to be best friends forever; by summerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s end theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve become TullyandKate. Inseparable.\n\nSo begins Kristin HannahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s magnificent new novel. Spanning more than three decades and playing out across the ever-changing face of the Pacific Northwest, Firefly Lane is the poignant, powerful story of two women and the friendship that becomes the bulkhead of their lives.\n\nFrom the beginning, Tully is desperate to prove her worth to the world. Abandoned by her mother at an early age, she longs to be loved unconditionally. In the glittering, big-hair era of the eighties, she looks to men to fill the void in her soul. But in the buttoned-down nineties, it is television news that captivates her. She will follow her own blind ambition to New York and around the globe, finding fame and success . . . and loneliness. \n\nKate knows early on that her life will be nothing special. Throughout college, she pretends to be driven by a need for success, but all she really wants is to fall in love and have children and live an ordinary life. In her own quiet way, Kate is as driven as Tully. What she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know is how being a wife and mother will change her . . . how sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll lose sight of who she once was, and what she once wanted. And how much sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll envy her famous best friend. . . .\n\nFor thirty years, Tully and Kate buoy each other through life, weathering the storms of friendship---jealousy, anger, hurt, resentment. They think theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve survived it all until a single act of betrayal tears them apart . . . and puts their courage and friendship to the ultimate test.\n\nFirefly Lane is for anyone who ever drank BooneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Farm apple wine while listening to Abba or Fleetwood Mac. More than a coming-of-age novel, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the story of a generation of women who were both blessed and cursed by choices. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about promises and secrets and betrayals. And ultimately, about the one person who really, truly knows you---and knows what has the power to hurt you . . . and heal you. Firefly Lane is a story youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll never forget . . . one youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll want to pass on to your best friend.\n\nBook 2: Fly Away (Firefly Lane #2) by Kristin Hannah (April 23rd 2013)\n\nOnce, a long time ago, I walked down a night-darkened road called Firefly Lane, all alone, on the worst night of my life, and I found a kindred spirit. That was our beginning. More than thirty years ago. TullyandKate. You and me against the world. Best friends forever. But stories end, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t they? You lose the people you love and you have to find a way to go on. . . .\n\nTully Hart has always been larger than life, a woman fueled by big dreams and driven by memories of a painful past. She thinks she can overcome anything until her best friend, Kate Ryan, dies. Tully tries to fulfill her deathbed promise to Kate--to be there for KateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s children--but Tully knows nothing about family or motherhood or taking care of people.\n\nSixteen-year-old Marah Ryan is devastated by her motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death. Her father, Johnny, strives to hold the family together, but even with his best efforts, Marah becomes unreachable in her grief. Nothing and no one seems to matter to her . . . until she falls in love with a young man who makes her smile again and leads her into his dangerous, shadowy world.\n\nDorothy Hart--the woman who once called herself Cloud--is at the center of TullyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tragic past. She repeatedly abandoned her daughter, Tully, as a child, but now she comes back, drawn to her daughterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s side at a time when Tully is most alone. At long last, Dorothy must face her darkest fear: Only by revealing the ugly secrets of her past can she hope to become the mother her daughter needs.\n\nA single, tragic choice and a middle-of-the-night phone call will bring these women together and set them on a poignant, powerful journey of redemption. Each has lost her way, and they will need each one another--and maybe a miracle--to transform their lives.\n\nAn emotionally complex, heart-wrenching novel about love, motherhood, loss, and new beginnings, Fly Away reminds us that where there is life, there is hope, and where there is love, there is forgiveness.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95502a4c6a85ed0d6bd3da67452c8edc5017f583","amp;dn":"Firefly+Lane+Series+%281-2%29+by+Kristin+Hannah+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95502a4c6a85ed0d6bd3da67452c8edc5017f583","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,80,42,76,106,133,237,13,107,211,218,103,69,44,142,220,80,23,245,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
