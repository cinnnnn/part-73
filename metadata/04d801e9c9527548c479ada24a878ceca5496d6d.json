The older ones largely contain inaccurate and outdated information where suppositions and theories are used, but still contain factual information not included in the others. Still worth the watch :) If you decide to only watch one, try &quot;Finding Amelia Earhart&quot;, as it's the most recent and confirms/expels theories mentioned in the first three.\n\nMore info on the search for Amelia and her missing aircraft can be found by googling: TIGHAR The Earhart Project\n\nTorrent Contents:\n\nAmelia Earhart The Price of Courage (TV) [1993] PBS\n\nThe Final Hours - Amelia Earharts Last Flight [2000]\n\nThe Amelia Earhart Conspiracy - The True Story [National Geographic 2007]\n\nFinding Amelia Earhart [Discovery Channel 2012] (Features the Niku VI expedition by the TIGHAR team.
