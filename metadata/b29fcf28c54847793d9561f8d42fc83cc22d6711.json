The five-act playÃ¢â‚¬â€the story of an incognito king whose love for the wife of a banished revolutionary brings on the chaos the king has fought to preventÃ¢â‚¬â€was never published in NabokovÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lifetime and lay in manuscript until it appeared in a Russian literary journal in 1997. It is an astonishingly precocious work, in exquisite verse, touching for the first time on what would become this great writerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s major themes: intense sexual desire and jealousy, the elusiveness of happiness, the power of the imagination, and the eternal battle between truth and fantasy. The play is NabokovÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s major response to the Russian Revolution, which he had lived through, but it approaches the events of 1917 above all through the prism of Shakespearean tragedy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b29fcf28c54847793d9561f8d42fc83cc22d6711","amp;dn":"Vladimir+Nabokov+-+The+Tragedy+of+Mister+Morn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b29fcf28c54847793d9561f8d42fc83cc22d6711","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,159,207,40,197,72,71,121,61,149,97,248,212,47,200,60,194,45,103,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
