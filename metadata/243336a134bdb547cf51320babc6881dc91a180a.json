But with its two leads oozing easy confidence, it's hearty, handsome and thoroughly entertaining\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 0.99b\nDuration.... 01:58:16\nCodec.... h264\nFrame Width..... 720\nFrame Height.... 304\nData Rate.... 1036kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate....164kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:243336a134bdb547cf51320babc6881dc91a180a","amp;dn":"The+Undefeated+1969+BrRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"243336a134bdb547cf51320babc6881dc91a180a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,51,54,161,52,189,181,71,207,81,50,11,171,198,136,29,201,26,24,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
