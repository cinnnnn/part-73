Pinewoods (03:11)\n\nAlessiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ark, the vessel for singer-songwriter Alessi Laurent-MarkeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s precocious talent, now has a third studio album with the release of The Still Life. The blossoming West London artist has yet to celebrate her 23rd birthday, but Laurent-MarkeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice is striking, capable of simultaneous seduction and subversion. The singer would be a shoe-in for the kind of outwardly puzzled, yet knowing heroine you might find in a David Lynch work.\nWhile her latest shares some commonality with its predecessors, especially her previous one, Time Travel, ArkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sonic palette has broadened to encompass both ethnic instruments and contemporary sound effects. Still, ArkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s songs are concise, straight pitches. On the short opening track, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tin SmithingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, her lyrics run into each other against a backcloth of chopping guitar and kalimba so that her voice is almost absorbed into the soundtrack. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s followed by the languid Ã¢â‚¬Å“Veins Are BlueÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, offering up a far more direct take on relationship fall-out, opening with: Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m doing exactly as I please / Falling but this time not grazing my kneesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nWith its sampled beats and odd discordant flurries, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The RainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ captures an even greater sense that AlessiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ark has moved forward sound-wise. Lyrically the song meshes notions of love and nature into one entity while the vocal harmonies in the choruses add real distinction. As you mine deeper into the album, a surprising variety of styles are revealed from the circus swing of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Big DipperÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to the bar room goodtime (Ã¢â‚¬Å“MoneyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and even a ghostly cover of The NationalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Afraid of EveryoneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nStand out Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sans BalanceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ begins as a more conventional folk song before the singer throws in a verse in French and later indulges us with a breath-stopping middle eight. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s simply exquisite. Laurent-Marke sings Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m told thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s good things IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve done / When youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re me you remember noneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on a teasingly brief Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Good SongÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Well, she ought to remember this record and for good.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5021fce4d3e00c5249e5473eb47fbdf418a20f38","amp;dn":"Alessi%27s+Ark+-+The+Still+Life+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5021fce4d3e00c5249e5473eb47fbdf418a20f38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,33,252,228,211,224,12,82,73,229,71,62,180,127,189,244,24,162,15,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
