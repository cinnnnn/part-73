Tonight's The Nerdist show on BBC America is so jam packed full of amazing\nthings that it's leaking out of the sides and making a mess all over the floor! Get\nout the Sham-Wow and the wet-vac because we're about to get beautiful all over your\ntelevision set. That's right - two of the best looking people on the planet join\nChris Hardwick tonight. We'll start with Joe Manganiello, who stars as the six foot\nfive werewolf on True Blood (and yes, we've determined that he actually is that tall\n- but can he get through our revolving door?) Plus, the lovely Morena Baccarin from\nFirefly and Homeland joins us. We'll enlist both of them to help us play a game\ncalled &quot;Obscure Comic Book Character, German Restaurant, or Dinosaur?&quot; Matt and\nJonah head off once more as our Nerdist ambassadors to the United Kingdom and well-\ndressed comedian Paul F. Tompkins spins some yarns.
