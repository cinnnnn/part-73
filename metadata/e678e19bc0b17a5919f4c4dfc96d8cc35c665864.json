And, yes, his very good looks. So she proposed a simple cup of coffee to talk about his future, never expecting to find herself wishing she were a part of it...\n\nBut until Fuller could talk about his past-- about family secrets, sacrifices and the faith that pulled him through-- his future was on hold. As was any relationship with Ana.\nOr was it?\n\nGenre: Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e678e19bc0b17a5919f4c4dfc96d8cc35c665864","amp;dn":"Love%27s+Healing+Touch+by+Jane+Myers+Perrine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e678e19bc0b17a5919f4c4dfc96d8cc35c665864","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,120,225,155,192,177,122,89,25,244,196,223,201,109,140,195,92,102,88,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
