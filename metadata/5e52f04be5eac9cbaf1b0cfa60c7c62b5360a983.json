Security is often described using the language of discrete probability. If you have time it will be helpful to review a bit of discrete probability before the course begins, for example using this wikibooks article: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/High_School_Mathematics_Extensions/Discrete_Probability&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/High_School_Mathematics_Extensions/Discrete_Probability&lt;/a&gt;\nWe will review a bit of discrete probability in the first week of the course.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e52f04be5eac9cbaf1b0cfa60c7c62b5360a983","amp;dn":"Stanford+Online+Course+Cryptography+I","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e52f04be5eac9cbaf1b0cfa60c7c62b5360a983","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,82,240,75,229,234,201,203,175,27,12,250,96,199,198,43,83,96,169,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
