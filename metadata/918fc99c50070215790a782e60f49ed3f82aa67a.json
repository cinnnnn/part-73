It is often cited as Faithfull's definitive recording; Faithfull herself describes it in her autobiography as &quot;the masterpiece&quot;. The album contains some of her most famous songs, including the title track and &quot;The Ballad of Lucy Jordan&quot;, and was notable for the controversy surrounding the final number &quot;Why D'Ya Do It&quot;.\n\n\n Review:\nFaithfull's immediately preceding albums, Dreamin' My Dreams and Faithless (which in fact shared some tracks), had been in a relatively gentle folk or country and western style. Broken English was a radical departure, featuring a contemporary fusion of rock, punk, New Wave and dance, with liberal use of synthesizers. After years of drug abuse, Faithfull's voice was in a lower register, far raspier, and had a more world-weary quality than in the past that matched the often raw emotions expressed in the newer songs.\nThe album's title track took inspiration from terrorist figures of the time, particularly Ulrike Meinhof of the Baader-Meinhof group. &quot;Guilt&quot; was informed by the Catholic upbringing of the singer and her composer Barry Reynolds. &quot;The Ballad of Lucy Jordan&quot;, originally performed by Dr Hook, was a melancholy tale of middle class housewife's disillusionment; Faithfull's version became something of an anthem and was used on the soundtracks to the films Montenegro (1981) and Thelma &amp; Louise (1991). &quot;WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the Hurry?&quot; was described by Faithfull as reflecting the everyday desperation of the habitual drug user. Her cover of John LennonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s &quot;Working Class Hero&quot;, recorded as a tribute to her own heroes such as Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, David Bowie and Iggy Pop, and Lennon himself, was widely praised.\nThe last track, the six-and-a-half-minute &quot;Why'd Ya Do It?&quot;, was a caustic, graphic rant of a woman reacting to her lover's infidelity. The lyrics began with the man's point of view, relating the bitter tirade of his jilted lover. It was set to a grinding tune inspired by Jimi HendrixÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recording of Bob DylanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot;. Poet and writer Heathcote Williams had originally conceived the lyrics as a piece for Tina Turner to record, but Faithfull succeeded in convincing him that Turner would never record such a number. Its plethora of four-letter words and explicit references to oral sex caused controversy and led to a ban in Australia. Local pressings had grooves of smooth vinyl in place of the track and a 'bonus' 7&quot; single of the extended version of &quot;Broken English&quot; as compensation. The ban did not extend to import copies, and the song was also played unedited on the Government-funded Double Jay radio station. It wasn't until 1988 when Island re-released the album in Australia and &quot;Why D'Ya Do It&quot; was finally included.\n\n\nTracklist:\nA1 Broken English 4:42\nA2 Witches' Song 5:00\nA3 Brain Drain 4:10\nA4 Guilt 5:05\nB1 The Ballad Of Lucy Jordan 4:16\nB2 What's The Hurry 3:17\nB3 Working Class Hero 4:41\nB4 Why'd Ya Do It 8:42\n\n\n\nGeneral:\nCountry: UK\nGenre: Rock, New Wave\nSource: Vynil \nFormat : FLAC/tracks+.cue\n\nAudio\n* * * MediaInspector for Mac - Version 2.0.1, build 900\n* * * Ã‚Â©2012 by Diego Massanti\n* * * MediaInfo Lib by Jerome Martinez\n* * * Raw File Report for Marianne Faithfull - Broken English - Original Mix.flac\n\nGeneral\nComplete name : /Volumes/Flac/(1979) Marianne Faithfull - Broken English [FLAC+.cue]/Marianne Faithfull - Broken English - Original Mix.flac\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec\nFile size : 768 MiB\nDuration : 39mn 48s\nOverall bit rate : 2 698 Kbps\n\nAudio\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec\nDuration : 39mn 48s\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 2 698 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 96.0 KHz\nBit depth : 24 bits\nStream size : 768 MiB (100%)\nWriting library : libFLAC 1.2.1 (UTC 2007-09-17)\n\nlink for Adobe Audition mastering and analysis","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:918fc99c50070215790a782e60f49ed3f82aa67a","amp;dn":"%281979%29+Marianne+Faithfull+-+Broken+English+%5BFLAC%2B.cue%5D%5BVinyl+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"918fc99c50070215790a782e60f49ed3f82aa67a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,143,201,156,80,7,2,21,121,10,120,46,96,244,158,211,248,42,166,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
