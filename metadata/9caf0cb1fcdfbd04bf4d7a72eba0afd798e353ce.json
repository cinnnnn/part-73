You guys should check it out!  anyways, here;s Airman:\n\nProfessor Claude Stevens, a renowned ornithologist, was senselessly murdered. His son Drake was outraged and received no justice from the police. So Drake put together a costume consisting of a pair of gas-filled wings and some bombs and went hunting for criminals. The gas made his wings lighter than air. Later, he added a jet pack that allowed him to travel over long distances at much faster speeds. He also used a gun in several adventures. \n\nseed for all to enjoy!
