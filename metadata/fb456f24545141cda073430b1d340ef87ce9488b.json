Producer Lewis Martinee fashioned ExposÃƒÂ© with a poppier sound on their sophomore set. What You Don't Know buy CD music The sturdy dance grooves are still there, but they're not as steeped in the nightclubs as those on Exposure. What You Don't Know songs A healthy variety of strong selections are included. Among the best are the spunky title track (a Top Ten pop hit), replete with snazzy horns, a colorful guitar solo, and a fiery lead vocal by Gioia; &quot;Stop, Listen, Look &amp; Think,&quot; a subtler uptempo number with an understated yet memorable lead by Ann Curless; and the sultry, summertime slow-groove &quot;When I Looked at Him&quot; (also a Top Ten hit), on which Jeanette Jurado's laid-back performance brings to mind Belinda Carlisle.
