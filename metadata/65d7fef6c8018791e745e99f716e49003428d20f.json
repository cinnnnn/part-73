We get perspective on the state of airport security. Chris Matthews of the Wall Street Journal gives us the latest on the trial of Osama bin Laden's son-in-law. And, in our signature segment, a look at an unlikely coalition between frackers and environmentalists in Pennsylvania.\n\nTorrents by CitizenD for the PBS NewsHour are added daily. \n\nMy IP address changes a lot, so the trackers often lose me, but any torrent I put up, I host for at least three weeks, so there will always be at least one seeder for that time even if it says 0. \n\nI recommend you download the SDTV versions if you want your news quicker.\n\n\nBe more PBS!\n\nSupport your local PBS station.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65d7fef6c8018791e745e99f716e49003428d20f","amp;dn":"PBS.NewsHour.2014.03.09.Sunday.SDTV.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65d7fef6c8018791e745e99f716e49003428d20f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,215,254,246,200,1,135,145,231,69,233,159,113,110,73,0,52,40,210,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
