It is taking our best computers to discover the Secrets that Yahweh has hidden in The Bible for us to dig out.  Proverbs 25:2.....It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter.\n\nDescription\n\nThe Bible code (Hebrew: Ã—Â¦Ã—Â¤Ã—Â Ã—â„¢Ã—ï¿½ Ã—â€˜Ã—ÂªÃ—Â &quot;Ã—Å¡Ã¢â‚¬Å½), also known as the Torah code, is a purported set of secret messages encoded within the Hebrew text of the Torah. This hidden code has been described as a method by which specific letters from the text can be selected to reveal an otherwise obscured message. Although Bible codes have been postulated and studied for centuries, the subject has been popularized in modern times by Michael Drosnin's book The Bible Code and the movie The Omega Code.\n\nMany examples have been documented in the past. One cited example is that by taking every 50th letter of the Book of Genesis starting with the first taw, the Hebrew word &quot;torah&quot; is spelled out. The same happens in the Book of Exodus. The word Modern computers have been used to search for similar patterns and more complex variants, and published as a &quot;challenging puzzle&quot; in a peer-reviewed academic journal in 1994. Proponents hold that it is exceedingly unlikely such sequences could arise by chance, while skeptics and opponents hold that such sequences do often arise by chance, as demonstrated on other Hebrew and English texts.\n\n\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n\n \nSeed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father. I have prayed to The Father, Bless all that Seed Long. (I have 4 year old active seeds out there, must be working for some folks!)\n\nEphesians 5:11\n11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.\n\n      :thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS  \n\n  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3194828691d8ba5d4e2dd6423078b87daae39aff","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+Prophecy+-+02+-+The+Bible+Codes+Part+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3194828691d8ba5d4e2dd6423078b87daae39aff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,148,130,134,145,216,186,93,78,45,214,66,48,120,184,125,170,227,154,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
