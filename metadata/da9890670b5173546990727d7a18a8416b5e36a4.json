Featuring acclaimed author and Hollywood film consultant Dr. Jack Shaheen, the documentary exposes American cinema's long love affair with Arab villainy and buffoonery, from over-sexed Bedouin bandits and submissive maidens, to sinister sheikhs and blood-thirsty terrorists.\n\nAlong the way, the film provides striking insights into the origin of these images, their disturbing similarities to anti-Semitic and racist stereotypes from the past, and their political resonance during key moments of conflict in U.S. history. In the end, Shaheen inspires us to thing critically about the destructive social and political effects of Hollywood's projection of Arabs, challenging us to envision counter-narratives that do justice to both the diversity and humanity of Arab people, and the reality and richness of Arab history and culture.\n\nPreviews:\n~Hijacking Catastrophe: 9/11, Fear &amp; the Selling of American Empire\n~Peace, Propaganda, and the Promised Land:\n  US Media &amp; The Israeli-Palestinian Conflict\n~On Orientalism, with the late Edward SaÃƒÂ¯d,\n Professor of English and Comparative Literature, Columbia University.\n\n&quot;The so-called independent media, in a liberal society like this, in effect are so lazy, and controlled by interests that are commercial and political at the same time, that there is no investigative reporting, it's just basically repeating the line of the government.&quot; ~ Edward SaÃƒÂ¯d\n\n&quot;And we never see, NEVER SEE, Palestinians who suffer under occupation, Palestinians in refugee camps, Palestinians who are victimized, who are killed; INNOCENT Palestinians. These images are denied us, now why are they denied? Is there an unwritten code in Hollywood saying we cannot, and will not humanize Palestinians? And why can't we humanize Palestinians in the same manner that we humanize Israelis? Is not the life of a Palestinian child, media-wise, Hollywood-wise, politically-wise, as important, as humane, as valuable, as the life of an Israeli child? And if the answer to that is yes, then why can't we see that on silver-screen?&quot; ~ Dr. Jack Shaheen\n\nHollywood and their ilk are playing both sides of the coin, so to speak. On one side, they are spreading hate and lies for the Pentagon and zionist war-machines, recruiting and such, and on the other side, they hope to cause us to demand additional (ADL, SPLC) hate-crimes legislation, which the zionists will then hide behind, making criticism of their crimes, and criticism of israel, an anti-Semitic 'hate-crime' punishable by triple penalties.. which has already been enacted and prosecuted successfully against Christians, actually.
