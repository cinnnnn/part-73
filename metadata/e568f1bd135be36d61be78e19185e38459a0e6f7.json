It was the brainchild of Sir Hiram Maxim, the American-born firearms inventor who founded the company bearing his name with financing from Albert Vickers, who became the companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chairman; MaximÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s company was absorbed by Vickers, Sons and Company in 1897. Subsequent variants in British, German and Russian service Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the .303in Vickers (1912), 7.92mm MG 08 (1908) and 7.62mm PM M1910, respectively Ã¢â‚¬â€œ dominated both the Eastern and Western Fronts during World War I and soldiered on into World War II, while the Vickers remained in front-line British service essentially unchanged until 1968. Featuring specially commissioned full-colour artwork and written by a noted authority, this is the engaging story of the Maxim and its descendants, the innovative rapid-fire weapons that saw combat with British, German, Russian and other forces in the late Victorian era and throughout the world wars.\n\nAmazon.com title link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Vickers-Maxim-Machine-Gun-Weapon/dp/1780963823&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Vickers-Maxim-Machine-Gun-Weapon/dp/1780963823&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e568f1bd135be36d61be78e19185e38459a0e6f7","amp;dn":"The+Vickers-Maxim+Machine+Gun+%28Osprey+Weapon+25%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e568f1bd135be36d61be78e19185e38459a0e6f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,104,241,189,19,91,227,109,97,190,120,225,145,133,227,132,89,160,230,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
