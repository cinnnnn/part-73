The files need for ODIN are located in here.\n\nDo you want to ROOT you phone? The files are included.\n\nWant to put a different operating system (ROM) on to your phone to get the most out of it? The torrent includes that following:\n\n1.) Cyanogenmod 11 Nightly\n2.) Modified MetroPCS ROM Deodexed etc\n3.) Baked ROM\n\n\nThe Modems included may help you with signal problems like dropped calls etc. But results will very. Good to try all and see which works best for you,\n\nBefore you flash ANY ROM or ROOT ANYTHING make sure to do the NVBACKUP... Oh and of course ALWAYS do nandroid back and make sure it is stored on your SD card not your internal.\n\nPLEASE SEED!!!\n\nI will be trying to make more of these types of torrents because these files can be hard to find and they are all that's needed to fix a bricked phone. Requests welcome!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18e550c494a985003af172e2f55cd2facaaa52df","amp;dn":"MetroPCS+Galaxy+S3+AIO+Root%2C+Stock+Image%2C%2BMORE+-FIXED-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18e550c494a985003af172e2f55cd2facaaa52df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,229,80,196,148,169,133,0,58,241,114,226,245,92,210,250,202,170,82,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
