Gone Country Dream (For Bill Doss)\n\n&quot;Campfires is a one man band Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jeff Walls Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and this is his debut under the moniker The production is fiercely lo-fi Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the short sharp bursts of energy could be likened to post-punk Ã¢â‚¬â€œ though the melody drifts a good fifteen years further back. What with its scratchy rhythm guitars and 60s vintage snapshot of psychedelic sunshine; CampfireÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut is soaked with colours from the past. Yet however heavy the debt may be the sound travels light and easy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ rambling through my sub-conscious with a carefree disposition and a bag full of friendly hooks.\n\nMoments like title track Tomorrow, Tomorrow and Fortune Teller standout with treble-heavy guitars and drifting melody. Meanwhile Glass Arrows feels like a nod to The Small Faces and Bayonet bends and rambles with a distorted, home-production charm. You do start to wonder if Walls recorded this with a release in mind Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it all goes down so damn easy.\n\nThis is a record without expectation and unconcerned with judgement Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and such freedom has allowed Walls to compile a set of tracks that are never short of infectious and consistently engaging.&quot;\n- Charlie Holt, BOWLEGS Music Review\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70db6f01c219546a42968a7f4f3edf6a57683e97","amp;dn":"Campfires+-+Tomorrow%2C+Tomorrow+%5B2013%5D+%5BFLAC+%2F+WEB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70db6f01c219546a42968a7f4f3edf6a57683e97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,219,111,1,194,25,84,106,66,150,138,127,79,62,223,106,87,104,62,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
