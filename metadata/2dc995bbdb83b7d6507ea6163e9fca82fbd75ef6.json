That night it was just his way with words that won over the Philadelphia crowd but in the coming months, it became evident to the fans there and around the country that Punk could back it up when the bell rang as well. Whether it was slugging it out in the squared circle with his long-time friend Colt Cabana or going toe-to-toe with a hard hitter like BJ Whitmer, Punk was as versatile a wrestler as any who had set foot in the ROH ring, and it was only a matter of time before success came his way.\n\nThrough months of bloody battles against Raven that cemented his status as a true warrior in ROH or technical showcases against AJ Styles, CM Punk showed Ring of Honor fans across the globe the skills that would take him to the top of the wrestling world. This 2-Disc, 17 match compilation highlights the beginnings of a career that would cement CM Punk as a true legend in the ROH history books.
