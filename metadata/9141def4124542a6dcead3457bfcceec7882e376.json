It is taking our best computers to discover the Secrets that Yahweh has hidden in The Bible for us to dig out.  Proverbs 25:2.....It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter.\n\nDescription\n\nThe Bible code (Hebrew: Ã—Â¦Ã—Â¤Ã—Â Ã—â„¢Ã—ï¿½ Ã—â€˜Ã—ÂªÃ—Â &quot;Ã—Å¡Ã¢â‚¬Å½), also known as the Torah code, is a purported set of secret messages encoded within the Hebrew text of the Torah. This hidden code has been described as a method by which specific letters from the text can be selected to reveal an otherwise obscured message. Although Bible codes have been postulated and studied for centuries, the subject has been popularized in modern times by Michael Drosnin's book The Bible Code and the movie The Omega Code.\n\n\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n\nSeed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father. I have prayed to The Father, Bless all that Seed Long. (I have 4 year old active seeds out there, must be working for some folks!)\n\nEphesians 5:11\n11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.\n\n      :thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS  \n\n  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9141def4124542a6dcead3457bfcceec7882e376","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+Prophecy+-+01+-+The+Bible+Codes+Part+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9141def4124542a6dcead3457bfcceec7882e376","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,65,222,244,18,69,66,166,220,234,211,69,123,252,206,236,120,130,227,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
