Read info there.\n2 - Patch the game using the files below in logical order to enjoy the game.\n3 - Find a suitable crack for you (my advice is to use the lumaemu crack.)\n4 - Enjoy.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n5 - ONLY IF YOUR GAME CRASHES OR FREEZES WHEN ENTERING THE MULTIPLAYER MENU \n\nYou have to clean your registry! You can use CCleaner or TuneUpUtilies or AdvancedSystemCare for that. Also remember to tell your firewall the arma3.exe file has changed since you've updated the game. So allow any promts comming from your firewall.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFILES INCLUDED:\n\nARMA3_patch-1_nosTEAM.exe\nARMA3_patch-3_nosTEAM.exe\nARMA3_patch-4_nosTEAM.exe\nARMA3_patch-5_nosTEAM.exe\nARMA3_patch-6-LANFIX_nosTEAM.exe\nARMA3_patch-7-LANFIX_nosTEAM.exe\nARMA3_patch-9_nosTEAM.exe\nARMA3_patch-11_nosTEAM.exe\n\nIt may seem there are some patches missing but there aren't.\n\n- Patch 3 includes patches 2 and 3\n- Patch 9 includes patches 8 and 9\n- Patch 11 includes patches 10 and 11\n\n\n\nIf you're using another release like 3DM remember \n\n#### USE AT YOUR OWN RISK ####\n\nI'm sure the patches will update other releases like 3DM as long as you know what you are doing. It will work even if you have applied an FTS patch before.\n\nFrom what i've seen, patch numbers coincide so FTS patch number is the same as nosTEAM patch number. And if you do something wrong the nosTEAM patches will inform you the file versions don't match to what they expect them to be.\n\nIt is MANDATORY to clean your registry in this situation.\n\n#### So remember to USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!! ####\n\n\n\nCREDITS:\n\nCREATION by the NOSteam.
