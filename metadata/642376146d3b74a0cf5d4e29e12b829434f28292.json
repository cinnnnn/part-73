On &quot;Grandpa Walked a Picketline,&quot; due Jan. 20, he sings of everyday folks, not always the desperate or destitute, but the overlooked and underappreciated.\n\n&quot;Calling out tonight to anyone who's tired of being down,&quot; he writes in &quot;To Anyone,&quot; echoing Guthrie's famous line about hating a song that makes you feel no good, or born to lose.\n\n&quot;Caroline&quot; follows a woman much like the matriarch in Dolly Parton's &quot;To Daddy,&quot; who leaves her family behind when she lights out in search of fulfillment after a lifetime of neglect. Gibbs gets impressively Dylanesque in &quot;Preacher Steve,&quot; about a charlatan who uses religion rather than snake oil to fleece his flock: &quot;Preacher Steve could walk on water while the whole world's dying of thirst.&quot;\n\nGibbs brings his characters to life with a vocal growl that sounds just one pack of Camels shy of Tom Waits, and he's assisted ably by a team of roots-music veterans, including bassist Don Dixon, steel guitarist-Dobro ace Al Perkins, mandolinist Tim Easton and producer Chris Stamey.\n\nThere couldn't be a better time for a voice this insightfully compassionate.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:642376146d3b74a0cf5d4e29e12b829434f28292","amp;dn":"Otis+Gibbs+-+Grandpa+Walked+A+Picketline+%5B2009%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"642376146d3b74a0cf5d4e29e12b829434f28292","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,35,118,20,109,59,116,160,207,93,78,41,225,43,130,148,52,242,130,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
