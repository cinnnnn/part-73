In the explosive season one finale, Elena's uncle set a plan in motion that brought the Founder's Day celebration to an end amid chaos, destruction and death, and saw the return of the vengeful Katherine Pierce. This season, Katherine's appearance in Mystic Falls will throw a wrench into the love triangle between Stefan, Elena and Damon, and the other residents of Mystic Falls must choose sides as they fall victim to a new breed of danger. New and unexpected friendships will be forged, allies will become enemies and hearts will be broken. Plus, Stefan and Damon will be forced to face a villain more evil and diabolical than they thought possible. The series stars Nina Dobrev, Paul Wesley, Ian Somerhalder, Steven R. McQueen, Sara Canning, Katerina Graham, Candice Accola, Zach Roerig, Michael Trevino and Matt Davis.\n\nPlease seed, and enjoy:)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e0171ba178a0b3f996e4e932d0683aeb3d4a855","amp;dn":"The+Vampire+Diaries+%28Season+2%29%28Ipod%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e0171ba178a0b3f996e4e932d0683aeb3d4a855","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,1,113,186,23,138,11,63,153,110,78,147,45,6,131,174,179,212,168,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
