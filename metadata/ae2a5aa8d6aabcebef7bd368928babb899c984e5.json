How else to explain all her good fortune? Her mama, though, has a different take: &quot;Lucky in life,&quot; she says, &quot;means unlucky in love.&quot; Her mama must be right, because Abby's been getting her heart broken since the sixth grade. But ever since she crossed into Bliss, Mississippi, a heavenly warm feeling has washed right over her. Abby's used to making up quirky, charming characters in her books, but here in Bliss it almost seems like those characters have sprung to life-and Abby is fantasizing about moving right in. And the love affair is mutual. Because the townspeople have set their matchmaking minds in motion, and they aren't about to let Abby leave without a little love in her heart.\n\n\nCast: \n\nLauren Holly ...
