But Jeff's clever counting makes Sarah realize her dad Earl isn't her biological father. Once movie clues from family indicate as suspect success author Beau Burroughs, she insists to get to meet him. Only like her mother and grandmother, she has a one night-stand with Beau, which may well cost her Jeff.\n\n\nIMDB Rating: 5.5/10\n\nGenre      : Comedy | Drama\nSize       : 700.11 MB\nQuality    : 720p\nResolution : 1280*720\nFrame Rate : 23.976 fps\nLanguage   : English\nSubtitles  : English\nRun Time   : 1hr 37 min\n\nEnjoy and please seed after downloading...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d92790e89ada7ea831ea190b3169e8f4c727d8b","amp;dn":"Rumor++%282005%29+720p+oracle999","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d92790e89ada7ea831ea190b3169e8f4c727d8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,146,121,14,137,173,167,234,131,30,161,144,179,22,158,143,76,114,125,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
