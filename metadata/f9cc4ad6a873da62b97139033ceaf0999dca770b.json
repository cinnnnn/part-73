The authorities say that Mia jumpedÃ¢â‚¬â€that her death was a suicide.\n\nAlthough theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d hardly spoken to each other since Mia suddenly left on an around-the-world trip six months earlier, Katie refuses to accept that her sister would have taken her own life. \n\nDistraught that they never made peace, Katie leaves her orderly, sheltered life in London behind and embarks on a journey to find out the truth. With only the entries in MiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s travel journal as her guide, Katie retraces the last few months of her sisterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life andÃ¢â‚¬â€page by page, country by countryÃ¢â‚¬â€begins to uncover the mystery surrounding her death. . . .\n\nWeaving together the exotic settings and suspenseful twists of Alex GarlandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Beach with a powerful tale of familial love in the spirit of Rosamund LuptonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Sister, Swimming at Night is a fast-paced, accomplished, and gripping debut novel of secrets, loss, and forgiveness.\n\nGenre: Mystery/Thriller/Suspense","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9cc4ad6a873da62b97139033ceaf0999dca770b","amp;dn":"Swimming+at+Night+by+Lucy+Clarke","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9cc4ad6a873da62b97139033ceaf0999dca770b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,204,74,214,168,115,218,98,185,113,57,3,60,234,240,153,157,202,119,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
