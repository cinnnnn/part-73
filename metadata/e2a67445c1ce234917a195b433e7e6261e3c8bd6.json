Werker. The film stars George Murphy, Finlay Currie, Virginia Gilmore, Karel Stepanek and Louisa Horton. It has also been released under the title: The Crime of the Century. \n\nWALK EAST ON BEACON! is an entertaining FBI procedural in the tradition of films such as THE HOUSE ON 92ND STREET (1945) and WALK A CROOKED MILE (1948). The movie will be particularly enjoyed by those such as myself who enjoy the &quot;docu-noir&quot; style and are interested in the Cold War era.\n\nDocumentary-style Cold War spy picture, shot on location in Boston and produced by Louis de Rochemont, best known for the March of Time newsreel. A celebration of the FBI, it makes frightening and/or funny viewing today. Says one apologetic Commie, finding you have a Party card is like 'finding yourself married to a woman you hate'. Made of sterner stuff is Red George Roy Hill: resisting arrest with the original 'You can't pin anything on me!', he went on to direct subversive classics like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Sting. More surprisingly, journalist Nora Sayre learned that the CIA was leasing some ten prints a year from Columbia, including a number dubbed into foreign languages, as late as 1980's.\n\nVideo surveillance back in 1952!\nAlthough made fifty years before the events of that terrible day, it might be instructive to view maverick producer Louis De Rochemont's anti-Communist docudrama Walk East on Beacon as a 9/11 movie.\n\nThe Red Scare had reached a fever pitch when director Alfred L. Werker (He Walked by Night) adapted this tale of Communist spies stealing secrets about the Manhattan Project. The source material was a Reader's Digest article by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, and the movie shares Hoover's obsession with surveillance, creating an atypical noir focused on technology rather than obsessed with character psychology. But the film did make abundant use of the mean streets with over 14 weeks of location shooting throughout the northeast, thus providing a rare snapshot of an era in American lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€its physical locations and its mental state.\n\nIt's amazing Walk East on Beacon, for all its dire stentorian warnings about the Soviet Union's schemes to subvert democracy, didn't convert thousands of horny American teenage boys to the sexy cause of Communism.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 1.43gb\nDuration.... 01:37:41\nCodec.... divx\nFrame Width..... 720\nFrame Height.... 540\nData Rate.... 1972kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23 F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 128kbps....
