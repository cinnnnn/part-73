My usual outfit is a 4-piece (guitar, bass, &amp; drums with either piano or harmonica), but I also put together intimate acoustic duos and large 6- or 8-piece bands. It has always been by goal to provide a traditional, but high-energy electric blues show. http://kylejester.com/\n\nBrent Harding on bass, current member of Social Distortion: Harding joined Social Distortion in November 2004. His first recording with the band was re-recordings of their older material and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Far BehindÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, which appear on their 2007 Greatest Hits album. He also appeared on the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seventh studio album Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes, which was released in January 2011. This would be the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first proper studio album with Harding. Prior to joining Social Distortion, Harding was the bass player for Mike Ness during his Cheating at Solitaire tour and recorded with Ness on his second solo offering Under the Influences. His previous bands include Deke Dickerson And The Ecco-Fonics, The Eugene Edwards Band, The Lucky Stars, The Sleepwalkers and The What-Me Worry? Jug Band. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Harding\n\nTom Essa Ã¢â‚¬Å“Slim CrowbarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on drums, formerly with Mississippi Mudsharks: The front man has the map, but the drummer does the drivinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ tow truck drivinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, on the road of American Roots RockinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. HittinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ the skins professionally for over 20 years, driving to thousands of performances over a million miles of road. LayinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ it down and groovinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ the American Roots influenced styles of Blues, Swing, Rockabilly and good olÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Rock &amp; Roll with The Mississippi Mudsharks, The Kyle Jester Blues Show, Big daddy and the Money Shakers, Billy Wtason, Hot Rod Lincoln and many more. Aside from years of stage and studio experiance, he also studied quite a bit, holding three degrees in music with stints in university concert band, symphonic band, big band and percussion ensemble. Fusing education and experiance into a unique drum style that delivers everything from a little tippy tap, to a fierce and blistering attackÃ¢â‚¬Â¦sometimes intense, sometimes comical. When he practices he think with his head, when he writes he thinks with his heart, when he performs he donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think at all!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a806a8497b73e5ba732b3850096e7b0f518c0e57","amp;dn":"Atomic+Road+Kings+EP+-+high+energy+harmonica+blues+-+WAV+files","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a806a8497b73e5ba732b3850096e7b0f518c0e57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,6,168,73,123,115,229,186,115,43,56,80,9,110,123,15,81,140,14,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
