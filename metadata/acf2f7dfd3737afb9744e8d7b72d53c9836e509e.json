Still Down Here (04:03)\n\nOn half the tunes here, McKenna collaborates with Nashville writers she met while she was making Unglamorous. Barry Dean produces and, with the exception of &quot;You Get a Love Song&quot; -- a track with a big country-rock sound that feels like a radio hit, complete with a screaming guitar solo -- he keeps the sound true to McKenna's quiet muse. Guitar, mandolin, and harmony vocals give the album the feel of a living-room performance. It's full of the complex love songs and working-class vignettes that McKenna is so good at","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acf2f7dfd3737afb9744e8d7b72d53c9836e509e","amp;dn":"Lori+McKenna+-+Lorraine+%5B2010%5D+%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acf2f7dfd3737afb9744e8d7b72d53c9836e509e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,242,247,223,211,115,122,251,151,68,232,215,183,45,83,201,131,110,80,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
