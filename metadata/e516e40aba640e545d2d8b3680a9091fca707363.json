For the second of his two High Voltage CD's, Ferguson primarily plays group originals (plus a slower-than-usual &quot;Star Eyes&quot;) that comes across as fairly routine and predictable. There is nothing particularly memorable about this pleasant but unadventurous set of music. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Omaha\n02 - Whatcha Thinkin'\n03 - Star Eyes\n04 - Till Then\n05 - Zihuatanejo\n06 - Nightgown\n07 - Get Off The Bus\n08 - King Kan\n\nSplit with Medieval. Sorry.\nEnjoy and share!
