The orchestra is absolutely perfect for Bruckner--silky strings, burnished brass, characterful woodwinds--yet the sound is transparent. Skrowaczewski's pacing is unerring, and, unlike Karajan, he seems emotionally involved. I certainly agree with the positive assessments of the two previous reviewers, although I can't imagine why one of them withheld the fifth star--at least three more are certainly deserved!\n\nIt might however, be remarked that one might want to supplement this set with Tintner's No.1, No.2, No.3, No.7 and No.8 because Tintner offers interesting alternative versions (especially No.8, which is QUITE different from the final version). One might also consider Lopez-Cobos' No.4 which gives an earlier and very different version of this work, very much worth hearing.\n\nFYI, Skrowaczewski performs the symphonies in the following versions; I apologize in advance for anything in this list with which anyone might disagree. Bruckner versions and editions are a rat's nest of confusion!: F minor (Nowak); No.1 (Haas, the so-called &quot;Linz&quot; version of 1877); &quot;0&quot; (Nowak); #2 (1st Nowak edition--a hybrid of 1877 and 1872); #3 (Nowak's edition of the 1888-89 version); #4 (Nowak's edition of the 1886 version); #5 (Nowak's edition of the 1878 version); #6 (Nowak); #7 (Nowak); #8 (Nowak's edition of the 1890 revised version); #9 (Nowak). I realize there's a lot more to Bruckner versions than this, so don't write in!\n\nOne last point, although Skrowaczewski's set is by far my favorite, Horst Stein outdoes him (and everyone else!) in No.6. Bruckner lovers owe it to themselves to not miss Stein's superb No.6 Bruckner: Symphony No. 6; Weber: Overtures.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3f0300a37daad1805cd035d3dc3a38b5a88c811","amp;dn":"Bruckner+11+Symphonies+Skrowaczewski+Saarbrucknen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3f0300a37daad1805cd035d3dc3a38b5a88c811","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,240,48,10,55,218,173,24,5,205,3,93,61,195,163,139,90,136,200,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
