The authors provide in-depth analyses with respect to Obama's handling of specific issues, including the economy, education, healthcare, criminal justice policy, the environment, immigration, Iraq and Afghanistan, race relations, gender issues, and gay/lesbian issues, covering topics in detail that general biographies of Obama and examinations of his political career miss. This book presents clear, accessible information for general readers, and contains in-depth discussion of topics useful to high school, college, and university students of sociology, government, political science, philosophy, and history.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c439624f973a6b3210191ab06223c74fbe266f5","amp;dn":"Grading+the+44th+President%3A+A+Report+Card+on+Barack+Obama%27s+Firs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c439624f973a6b3210191ab06223c74fbe266f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,67,150,36,249,115,166,179,33,1,145,171,6,34,60,116,251,226,102,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
