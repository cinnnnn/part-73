This doesn't quite work in terms of computer tablet viewing, so the official release awkwardly split that spread across three digital pages.\n\nI took the available artwork at its current resolution and size to create an amenable story flow solution for myself.\n\nWhat I'm uploading are my source files, working file and flattened JPEG that you can reinsert into issue 264, should you wish.\n\nJust rename the .cbz file to .zip, unarchive and place the JPEG in the folder. Rezip, rename the suffix to .cbz and you have your comic book again.\n\nLet me know what your thoughts are on re-editing and your ideas.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66a9b45d356fda58e6a39ae906bbc0b15b1b0334","amp;dn":"Iron+Man+264+pg10+replacement","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66a9b45d356fda58e6a39ae906bbc0b15b1b0334","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,169,180,93,53,111,218,88,230,163,154,233,6,187,192,177,91,27,3,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
