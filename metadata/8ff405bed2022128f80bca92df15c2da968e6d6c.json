It is the \nsame in the spiritual realm: \nGod acts according to laws. So \noften we get discouraged and \nbelieve that prayer is useless \nwhen our prayers do not get \nanswered. However, the actual \nreason  is that we have not \nfulfilled God's laws which are a \ncondition for prayer.\n\n\n\n1. The Law of a Pure Heart\n \n2. The Law of a Forgiving Spirit\n \n3. The Law of the Right Motive\n\n4. The Law of Faith\n \n5. Pray According to the Will of God\n \n6. Praying in the Name of Jesus\n \n7. Praying in the HolySpirit\n \n Provided that we walk in the Spirit, nothing will be impossible to us.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ff405bed2022128f80bca92df15c2da968e6d6c","amp;dn":"Seven+Laws+of+Prayer+%28+jesus%2C+the+bible%2Cgospel%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ff405bed2022128f80bca92df15c2da968e6d6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,244,5,190,210,2,33,40,248,11,202,146,223,21,194,218,150,142,109,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
