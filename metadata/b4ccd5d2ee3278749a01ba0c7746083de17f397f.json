Weekapaug included Jungle Boogie lyrics and a Divided Sky tease; Weekapaug, YEM, First Tube, and Chalk Dust also included Auld Lang Syne teases. Seven Below was unfinished. The house music played over the P.A. during the second setbreak consisted solely of songs that referenced Ã¢â‚¬Å“carsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in their titles. As midnight neared during Jungle Boogie (a Phish debut), FishÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drum kit was wheeled to the side of the stage. An Austin Cooper Mini automobile was lowered to the stage from above. The Miami Palmetto Senior High Band and cheerleading squad emerged from the car one-by-one, giving the impression that they were all in the car together. In reality, the car had touched down over a trap door in the stage and the guests came out from underneath. Also emerging were dancers similar to the bunny-women present at the IT Festival. The marching band joined in on the jam that emerged from Jungle Boogie. With the stage covered with marching band members and dancers (some even on top of PageÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s baby grand piano), an emcee (dressed in an Eddie George, Tennessee Titans, #27 football jersey) counted the clock down to midnight. A massive balloon drop followed. Phish then led the marching band through an instrumental version of Iron Man (also a Phish debut). Reba did not have the whistling ending. For his Ã¢â‚¬Å“first song of 2004,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ in honor of the Miami Heat, Fishman performed the Phish debut of Feel the Heat. HYHU contained more references to Ã¢â‚¬Å“HenriettaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s HeatÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as Fishman took laps around the stage. Frankenstein was preceded by a Fluffhead tease.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4ccd5d2ee3278749a01ba0c7746083de17f397f","amp;dn":"Phish+-+2003-12-31+-+American+Airlines+Arena+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4ccd5d2ee3278749a01ba0c7746083de17f397f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,204,213,210,238,50,120,116,154,1,186,12,119,70,8,61,225,127,57,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
