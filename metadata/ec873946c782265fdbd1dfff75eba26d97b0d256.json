(Backup + Restore capability)\n- Sort your search results\n- Download a torrent using your default torrent application (must handle magnet links)\n- Share or open browser for any search results and torrent links\n- Choose proxy URLs if The Pirate Bay is blocked or down.\n- Holo common look and feel from 2.2 and up\n\nThe application and I, the developer, are not affiliated with The Pirate Bay.\n\nThe application is optimized for large screens in landscape orientation for the search results and torrent info screens. Let me know if there are any issues with this since I don't actually have a tablet, only tested on emulators.\n\nLimitations/Known Issues:\n- Cannot go directly to a Pirate Bay user through the search. You can however access the torrents of a user through the link of one of their torrents\n- The comments in the torrent info is limited the the last/most current page\n- The search results will load a maximum of 10 pages at the moment\n- Cannot edit the name of your favourites. At the moment, they match either your search criteria or the torrent name. Also cannot re-order them.\n\nIMPORTANT: I am one developer that worked on this on my free time. This app is quite useful for myself and I thought I would share. Therefore, please contact me if there are ANY issues.\n\nI tested this app on my Nexus 4 (4.2.2) and on emulators from 2.2 and up.\n\nThis application uses The Pirate Bay website. Please make sure that The Pirate Bay website is working if you encounter any issues. The application does not track any usage.\n\nPermissions:\n- INTERNET: Internet connection only for The Pirate Bay website\n- WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: For backing up and restoring your favourites\n\nThanks to:\n- ActionBarSherlock\n- HoloEverywhere\n- ViewPagerIndicator\n\nEnjoy!\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec873946c782265fdbd1dfff75eba26d97b0d256","amp;dn":"The+Pirate+Bay+Android+v1.6.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec873946c782265fdbd1dfff75eba26d97b0d256","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,135,57,70,199,130,38,95,219,209,223,255,117,235,162,109,151,176,210,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
