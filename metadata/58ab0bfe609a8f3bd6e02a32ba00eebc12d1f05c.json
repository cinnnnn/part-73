Hardly anyone attended an anti-gun event in Austin, Texas yesterday which took place right in the middle of SXSW, an internationally-known entertainment festival that attracts thousands from around the world. \n\nIn contrast, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) overwhelmingly won the CPAC straw poll as the most popular potential presidential candidate and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tx.) came in second. \n\nMore and more Americans are rejecting authoritarianism in favor of liberty and the potential it offers to humanity. \n\nAlso on today's show, Anthony Gucciardi breaks down key developments in health currently taking place.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
