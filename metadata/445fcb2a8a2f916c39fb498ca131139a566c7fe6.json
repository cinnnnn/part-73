They started as a group of friends playing just to kill time and since then they managed to become one of the best bands in the region. Here are all their records I could find (including the only one &quot;official&quot;, which technically makes it a discography), all in both MP3 and FLAC (that's why it's so big. sorry...)\n\nContents (both formats): \n\n(2012) Nemo Music Bar LIVE\n(2012) DEMO\n(2013) BanÃƒÂ¡ni v Kleci LIVE\nsome photos and stuff...\n\n\n\nBandzone: bandzone.cz/rapidmatic\n\nhope you'll enjoy listening to them! (^_^)\n\n\n\nbtw sorry if i messed anything up. this is my 1st upload ever. also sorry for my crappy english\n\nand just 1 more thing: if you find any problem with this, any non-playing song or wrong tag (or even worse!), be sure to write about it in the comments and I'll repair it. somehow...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:445fcb2a8a2f916c39fb498ca131139a566c7fe6","amp;dn":"Banana+Raincoat+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"445fcb2a8a2f916c39fb498ca131139a566c7fe6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,95,203,42,138,47,145,108,57,251,73,140,161,49,19,154,86,108,127,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
