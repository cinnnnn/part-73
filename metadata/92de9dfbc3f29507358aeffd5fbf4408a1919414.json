I notice it takes a while with direct download to get the .iso so if we get a torrent going with plenty seeders, it will be faster download even if you have a 1.5-3 meg dsl connection, the servers there at ubuntu can get tied up at times, us seeders here at the pirate bay sharing with fast connections can help, I have a 7-8meg adsl download rate at the time I think my upload rate is 3 megs I will start this out when I sleep at maxing the up rate at 150 kbps, then when someone gets 1 seed ratio they can seed and the speed for others can go up depending how fast they share.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92de9dfbc3f29507358aeffd5fbf4408a1919414","amp;dn":"Ubuntu+12.04.4+LTS+32+and+64+bit+Editions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92de9dfbc3f29507358aeffd5fbf4408a1919414","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,222,157,251,195,242,149,7,53,138,239,253,95,191,68,8,161,145,148,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
