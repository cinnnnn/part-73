Any Old Time\n\nProduced by Wayne and his longtime producer/collaborator Lloyd Maines (Uncle Tupelo, Wilco, Dixie Chicks, Joe Ely), Ride further cements Wayne's life-long calling [&quot;All I want to do is play the Joints 'til the day I die&quot;&gt; as a modern-day traditionalist through his signature mÃ¢â‚¬Å¡lange of roadhouse blues, hepcat boogie, rockabilly, and juke joint swing. As Hank III once said, &quot;Wayne Hancock has more Hank Sr. in him than either I or Hank Williams Jr. He is the real deal.&quot; Ride is built on a vibe that is at once more direct and personal than those of his previous Bloodshot releases Viper of Melody (2009), Tulsa (2006), Swing Time (2003), and A-Town Blues (2001). &quot;The album is an organic reaction to life's challenges ... these are not sad songs,&quot; the South TX native said of his 8th overall album and 5th for Bloodshot.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb0271e9aeea72f8b0aab8d123ddc33dd91ba1fb","amp;dn":"Wayne+Hancock+-+Ride%5B2013%5D%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb0271e9aeea72f8b0aab8d123ddc33dd91ba1fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,2,113,233,174,234,114,248,176,170,184,209,35,221,195,61,217,27,161,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
