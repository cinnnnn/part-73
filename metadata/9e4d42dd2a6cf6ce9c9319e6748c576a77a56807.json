She solved crimes with the aid of a magic ring that contains &quot;black gas&quot; that knocked out her opponents.\n\nIn her first adventure, Black Orchid took on (the somewhat unfortunately named) Doctor Arso to regain some stolen surgical papers, and she fought zombies, too. In the second adventure, she battled a man named Carson (and his Torchmen) who had kidnapped a scientist.\n\nUnlike many heroes, Black Orchid wore a multi-piece costume made up of a skirt, an overcoat and a leotard. It was a good thing, too, because her overcoat and skirt always got damaged during the course of her stories, forcing her to discard them. \n\nAppearances in the Golden Age:\n\nTops Comics (unnumbered)(1944) \n\n\nPlease seed for all to enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e4d42dd2a6cf6ce9c9319e6748c576a77a56807","amp;dn":"Black+Orchid+Archive+1944+Complete++Golden+Age","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e4d42dd2a6cf6ce9c9319e6748c576a77a56807","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,77,66,221,42,108,246,206,156,147,25,230,116,140,87,106,119,165,104,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
