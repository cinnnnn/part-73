Even if there were other galaxies with planets very similar to earth, life could only be there if the Creator had fashioned it. If God had done that, and if these beings were going to visit us one day, then He would surely not have left us unenlightened about this.\n\nGod has given us rather specific details of the futureÃ¢â‚¬â€for example, the return of Jesus, and some details about the end of the world. The universe will, at some future point, be rolled up like a scroll (Isaiah 34:4, Revelation 6:14). If God had created living beings elsewhere, this would automatically destroy their dwelling place as well. Adam's sin caused all of creation to be affected by the Curse, so why would a race of beings, not of Adam's (sinful) seed, have their part of creation affected by the Curse, and then be part of the restoration brought about by Christ, the last Adam? All of this would seem exceedingly strange.[1]\n\nSome have claimed that the nephilim, or the Ã¢â‚¬Å“sons of God,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ both mentioned in Genesis 6:2-4, were aliens. This is a wild extension of a common view that the Ã¢â‚¬Å“sons of GodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ who married the Ã¢â‚¬Å“daughters of menÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ were fallen angels, and that the nephilim were products of those Ã¢â‚¬Å“marriages.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Sons of GodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is clearly used of angels in Job 38:7. The Septuagint (LXX) here translates Ã¢â‚¬Å“sons of GodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as Ã¢â‚¬Å“angels of God.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ This need not mean that evil angels, or demons, actually cohabited with womenÃ¢â‚¬â€Jesus made it clear that angels do not engage in sexual activities, at least not angels in heaven (Matthew 22:30). Nevertheless, evil angels on earth could have used the bodies of ungodly men, by demonic possession, to achieve their evil purpose of producing an evil generation of people (Genesis 6:12).[2]\n\nThere are other reasonable suggestions as to the identity of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“sons of GodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the Nephilim. Interestingly, the word nephilim is only used here and in Numbers 13:33, where it clearly refers to the descendants of Anak, who were big people, but still people. Furthermore, Ã¢â‚¬Å“sons of GodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is not used exclusively of angelsÃ¢â‚¬â€the children of Israel are called Ã¢â‚¬Å“the sons of the living GodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in Hosea 1:10 (see also Psalm 73:15; 80:17).\n\nBible scholars such as H.C. Leupold believe that the Ã¢â‚¬Å“sons of GodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ were descendants of Seth, the godly line who are detailed in the preceding chapter (Genesis 4:25-5:32). Leupold wrote, Ã¢â‚¬Å“But who were these Ã¢â‚¬Ëœsons of GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢? Without a shadow of a doubt, the Sethites.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½[3] In this view, the descendants of Seth became wayward and married the Ã¢â‚¬Å“daughters of menÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ indiscriminately, basing their choice only on appearance, without concern for godliness, and the nephilim were their offspring.\n\nEgyptian (photo copyrighted) (Courtesy of Films for Christ).Rulers in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia often proclaimed themselves as Ã¢â‚¬Å“sons of GodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to enhance their power and prestige. So, another view with much support is that the Ã¢â‚¬Å“sons of GodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ were power-hungry rulers and despots, who, in their hunger for power and influence, took many wives in polygamy. They, and their offspring, through tyranny, became Ã¢â‚¬Å“mighty men.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Nimrod was described as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“mighty oneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in Genesis 10:8.)\n\nSo, there is no need to resort to fanciful suggestions involving aliens to understand this passage of Scripture.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a184716cae2688d11a35e400a4a60ea2ae385e50","amp;dn":"N+O+A+H+S++-++A+R+K++-++Fact+of+Fiction+-+The+Nephilim+-+Genesis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a184716cae2688d11a35e400a4a60ea2ae385e50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,132,113,108,174,38,136,209,26,53,228,0,164,166,14,162,174,56,94,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
