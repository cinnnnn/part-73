And, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll do itÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nThe Biggest Breakthrough Discovery In Seduction, Self-Help and Possibly Even In Neuro-Science That Has Ever Been Made\n\nAnd if this sounds even remotely interesting to you, then pleaseÃ¢â‚¬Â¦just sit back relax, and listen very closely to what I have to say. At worst you might lose a few minutes of your timeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦at best, you might just change your life.\n\nMy name is Tony Ruca and in the last two years alone IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve slept with over 300 women. But before I did that, I had spent almost my entire teens and young adult life as a total looser.\n\nRaised by a feminist mother, I used to think that being the Ã¢â‚¬Å“knight in a shining armorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was not only the way to win a womanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s affection, but it was also to be my purpose in life.\n\nBut I wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t your typical nice-guy who made friends with all the girls, listening to their baloney. No, I was even worse off than that.\n\nI couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even talk to women. Deep inside I wanted to ravish them, but years and years of bad social conditioning had made me completely unable to have a natural conversation with anything that didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a dick between its legs.\n\nI used to think; why would they even want to talk to me in the first place? After all, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m just a Ã¢â‚¬Å“dirty pigÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (as my mother used to say).\n\nThe pain continued to grow within me. Would I ever have a girlfriend in my life? Would I always have to be alone on a Saturday night when all the people I knew where out partyingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦drinkingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦dancingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and having sex?\n\nThe pain got so big that I could only see one way out.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6be295976bde5759bbf39d99461e1d228762e57","amp;dn":"Tony+Ruca+-+The+Alpha+System","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6be295976bde5759bbf39d99461e1d228762e57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,190,41,89,118,189,229,117,155,191,57,217,148,97,225,210,40,118,46,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
