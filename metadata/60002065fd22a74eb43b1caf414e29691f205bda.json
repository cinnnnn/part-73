Included in this torrent are 4 of the 5 original albums (with the exception of &quot;My Movie of You&quot;, which I have yet to find). These albums have long been out of print. However, as of the late 2000s, they have been digitally remastered on CD, in the form of two relatively obscure double album discs. The first is &quot;Leif Garrett/Feel the Need&quot; and the second, &quot;Same Goes For You/Can't Explain&quot;, both of which I have ripped personally. Also included is &quot;Three Sides of Leif Garrett&quot;, featuring the single with his 90s band Godspeed, as well as selections from his current band, F8.\n\n\nContents:\n\nLeif Garrett (1977)\n\nFeel the Need (1978)\n\nSame Goes For You (1979)\n\nCan't Exaplain (1980)\n\n&quot;Three Sides of Leif Garrett (2007)\n\n\nPlease seed!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60002065fd22a74eb43b1caf414e29691f205bda","amp;dn":"Leif+Garrett++albums+1977-2007+%28CD+Rip+320k%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60002065fd22a74eb43b1caf414e29691f205bda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,0,32,101,253,34,167,78,180,59,28,175,65,78,41,105,31,32,91,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
