McQueen). On her first day back at Mystic Falls High School, Elena meets the mysterious new guy, Stefan (Paul Wesley - Everwood), and the two seeming lost souls form an instant connection. What Elena doesn't know, however, is that Stefan is a vampire, constantly resisting the urge to taste her blood. But Stefan, it seems, has a greater evil to deal with when his dangerous older brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder - Lost), shows up to wreak havoc on the town of Mystic Falls Ã¢â‚¬â€ and claim Elena for himself. The Vampire Diaries is based on the best-selling book series from Alloy Entertainment. Think you know vampires? You don't.\n\nThis torrent is fixed, other one had problems with the final episode.\nPlease seed and enjoy:)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0fb287def35f01ea9370e2cef0a329efddfacd5","amp;dn":"The+Vampire+Diaries+%28Season+1%29%28Ipod%29%28Fixed%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0fb287def35f01ea9370e2cef0a329efddfacd5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,251,40,125,239,53,240,30,169,55,14,44,239,10,50,158,253,223,172,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
