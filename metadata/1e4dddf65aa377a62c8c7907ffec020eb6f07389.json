And what a drive the mid-engined coupe turned out to be. For those that need more space, and have a few more dollars to spend, we have a review of the new Rapide S, a genuine sports car that just happens to have four-doors.\nEver fancied yourself as a racer, but just never found the time or money to compete? YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find our feature on track day heroes to be of interest, but if the family is more of a priority, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got reports on the go anywhere Colorado7 and the new, upmarket Santa Fe.\n \nAlso driven this month; a new Pulsar, a sub $30k hybrid, the fastest Volvo V40, a dressed-up Lexus limo, and a likeable mid-sized sedan from Hyundai plus we have stories on the revised Ducati Multistrada, a stunt ready KTM, a painstakingly restored Mustang Mach 1, a review of the new Highlands Motorsport Park and a pictorial of the V8 SupercarsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ return to Pukekohe, plus much more.  . \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e4dddf65aa377a62c8c7907ffec020eb6f07389","amp;dn":"NZ+Autocar+May+2013+-+Mr+Festus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e4dddf65aa377a62c8c7907ffec020eb6f07389","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,77,221,246,90,163,119,166,44,140,121,7,255,236,2,14,182,240,115,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
