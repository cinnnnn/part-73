The tale revolves around the mysterious vanishing of guests from a hostel deep in the Australian rain forests of Gippsland, Victoria in 1896, run by the Straulles, an Austrian couple. Unfortunately the owners of this wayside inn are simply not as sinisterly menacing as Anthony Perkins' Norman Bates in Hitchcock's classic Psycho.\n\nVideo info: XviD - 320x224 - 23.976fps - 1h 57mn 27s 541ms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6abeaca44e5b88018a88fbffc44a800706ab64e1","amp;dn":"Inn+of+the+Damned+%5B1975%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6abeaca44e5b88018a88fbffc44a800706ab64e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,190,172,164,78,91,136,1,138,136,251,255,196,74,128,7,6,171,100,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
