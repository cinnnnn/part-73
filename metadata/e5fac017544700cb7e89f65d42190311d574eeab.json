Highlights include a heavy, energetic 18-minute &quot;Ghost&quot; and one of the most celebrated versions of &quot;Harry Hood&quot; of the late 1990s. After a 12-minute &quot;Brother&quot;, guitarist Trey Anastasio says the band will now play the &quot;radio friendly&quot; version, resulting in a humorous ten-second version of the song. Before the band played the next song, &quot;Ghost&quot;, they inform the audience that the song is &quot;radio un-friendly, because it's really long, and really slow&quot; .\n\nDisc one\n&quot;Tweezer&quot; (Anastasio, Fishman, Gordon, McConnell) - 16:58\n&quot;Taste&quot; (Anastasio, Fishman, Gordon, Marshall, McConnell) - 11:07\n&quot;Bouncing Around the Room&quot; (Anastasio, Marshall) - 3:49\n&quot;Funky Bitch&quot; (Seals) - 6:57\n&quot;Ginseng Sullivan&quot; (Blake) - 4:35\n&quot;Limb by Limb&quot; (Anastasio, Herman, Marshall) - 10:06\n&quot;Lawn Boy&quot; (Anastasio, Marshall) - 2:59\n&quot;Character Zero&quot; (Anastasio, Marshall) - 8:31\n\nDisc two\n&quot;Birds of a Feather&quot; (Anastasio, Fishman, Gordon, Marshall, McConnell) - 15:57\n&quot;2001&quot; (Deodato) - 16:40\n&quot;Brother&quot; (Anastasio, Fishman, Gordon, McConnell) - 12:35\n&quot;Brother&quot; (Anastasio, Fishman, Gordon, McConnell) - 1:02\n\nDisc three\n&quot;Ghost&quot; (Anastasio, Marshall) - 17:49\n&quot;The Lizards&quot; (Anastasio) - 12:27\n&quot;David Bowie&quot; (Anastasio) - 16:25\n&quot;Harry Hood&quot; (Anastasio, Fishman, Gordon, Long, McConnell) - 16:40\n\nNotes: 2001 was unfinished.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5fac017544700cb7e89f65d42190311d574eeab","amp;dn":"Phish+-+1998-04-04+-+Providence+Civic+Center+%28Archival+Release%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5fac017544700cb7e89f65d42190311d574eeab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,250,192,23,84,71,0,203,126,137,246,93,66,25,3,17,213,116,238,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
