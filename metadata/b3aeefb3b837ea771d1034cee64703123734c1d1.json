With a nice Menu system, that took ages to set up..\nThe weapons and vehicles take up most of these scripts..\n\n*IMPORTANT* = Some scripts will not work! Some will only work on Arma 2 CO/OA, Some scripts will stuff up other scripts eg; don't use ESP script, unless you want to not be able to use GOD Mode or invisible!\n\n**DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME OF THE FOLDER/FOLDERS/CONTENTS!**\n**DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME OF THE FOLDER/FOLDERS/CONTENTS!**\n\nHOW TO USE :\n\nThe only script you will have to run is &quot;Launcher.sqf&quot;\nI use Cheat Engine, so this is what the String/Code looks like..\n\nFirst Scan =\n\nprivate [&quot;_dummy&quot;]; _dummy = [_this,&quot;onload&quot;] execVM &quot;cauiscriptsdedicatedServerInterface.sqf&quot;;\n\nChange too =\n\nprivate [&quot;_dummy&quot;]; _dummy = [_this,&quot;onload&quot;] execVM &quot;RUNLauncher.sqf&quot;;\n\nThan close cheat engine after that! And it will work even if you leave that server.\nUntil you restart your ARMA 2, than you will need to run the script\n\nTo run the script once on a server hold &quot;CONTROL&quot; Than press &quot;P&quot;\nOr \nClick &quot;M&quot; and go to &quot;Server Controls&quot; or whatever the admin panel is called..\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThis Combination, Combines of! : \n#Help Menus\n#Give weapon ( Every possible weapon, including backpacks, Misc, Grenades + Launchers\n#Spawn Ammunition Crates\n#Remove Self Inventory\n#Add Magazine to Held Weapon\n#Any type of Vehicle (Assorted by Version)\n#Flip Vehicle\n#Repair\n#Constant Repairing\n#Car God Mode\n#Delete Vehicle (Aim cursor at)\n#Static Vehicles\n#CLR Money Scripts (List Of Constant Given Money Every 20 Seconds/Certain Amount)\n#Unlock Near Car\n#Unlock Near Air\n#Spawn Friendly AI\n#Spawn Enemy AI (60M away)\n#God Mode\n#Teleport\n#Respawn Quick\n#GAU-8\n#Invisible\n#Infinite Ammo\n#Auto Admin\n#Kill Yourself &gt;:)\n#Multiplayer ESP (WALLHACK)\n#Vehicle and AI ESP (WALLHACK)\n#FIXFPS\n#Heal\n#Numerous Movement Actions (Fake Death/Dance/Sit Down)\n#Environment Options (Remove Grass)\n#Day/Night (Only for yourself)\n#Multiple screen colour changes\n#Give Other Player Weapons (Only seems to give to AI?)\n#Remove Other Players inventory (^^)\n#Add Magazine to other players Inventory (^^)\n#Spectate Players\n#Make player Sit Down/Dance/Die (Movement Action)\n#Falling LHD's \n#Parachuting Buses\n#Create Mortal Combat Map\n#Create Battle Dome COD4 Map\n#Create Admin Base\n#Spawn Objects like buildings\n#Nukes\n#List of spawnable vehicles of server\n#Shit More!\n\nMy Personal Favourites!\n#Flying Fishing Boat :D \n#Flying Tank (GTA SA MotherFacker!)\n#Flying LHD (Land Destroyer)\n#Drive - able Static KORD (Moving Heavy MG )\n#Drive - able M119 ( Portable Artillery ) \n#Drive - able ZU23 ( Portable AA )\n#Drive - able LHD with Tank\n#Drive - able MG42 Nest\n#Monster Tank (APC + 5/6 Tanks? = GAU 8, Close range-Long Range MLR's)\n#Super Speed !
