The author provides a compelling inside view of how AS pupils perceive and understand what goes on in the classroom, and how they, in turn, are perceived by fellow pupils and teachers. She adopts a pragmatic approach to improving communications in the classroom and offers practical intervention strategies to increase mutual understanding and create a rewarding and supportive learning environment. The book also includes many examples of behavior commonly observed in AS children, and illuminating accounts of specific children's experiences, which help to understand the learning process and avoid misunderstandings. This accessible book is a key resource for educators and parents of AS children and provides invaluable guidance and strategies for professionals who need to understand how AS pupils learn and communicate.\n\nAbout the Author\nPaula Jacobsen, a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, is a psychotherapist in private practice in Los Gatos, California.
