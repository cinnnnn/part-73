It was written by John Byrne, with illustrations by Byrne and Tom Palmer.\n\nThe series was intended to fill in the team's chronology during the early 1970s when the original X-Men comic (#67Ã¢â‚¬â€œ93) was publishing only reprints of earlier issues. According to Byrne, the series &quot;was clearly finite, since [Giant-Size X-Men #1] was out there as an &quot;end point&quot; for my series, but the way I had it worked out, I could have easily done 100 issues or more before I had to send the team off to Krakoa.&quot; However, as part of a retooling of the X-Men line, X-Men: The Hidden Years was cancelled, prematurely ending its run with issue #22.\n\nHidden Years featured the cast of the original X-Men and their villains, with a few appearances by characters who had not otherwise appeared at that point in time, such as Storm.\n\n------\n\nFrom John Byrne, at the Byrne Robotics message board:\n\n[Quoting a fan] &quot;It's a real shame this title wasn't left alone..&quot;\n\nI can also turn that phrase, and say it was &quot;left alone&quot; too much! It was while I was working on HIDDEN YEARS that I coined the phrase &quot;stealth marketing&quot;. In the nearly two years it ran, the book got almost no push from Marvel's promotions department.\n\n(In the end, it was a bit of a shaggy dog story, too. After decades of fans crying for my return to the X-Men, when I finally did return, the chorus became &quot;Not THOSE X-Men!&quot; I sometimes wonder if it would have made a difference if I'd listened to those who wanted me to try to persuade Terry Austin to ink the book. Terry and I had moved a long way apart, stylistically, and the results would not have looked like our previous collaboration on the characters. Nor would it have looked how I wanted the book to look. Would it have helped draw attention to the title Marvel was so relentlessly ignoring?)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ec4b8942d9d3ddebcfe340291799f934defe1ff","amp;dn":"X-MEN+-+THE+HIDDEN+YEARS+01-22+%281999-2001%29+%28Marvel%29+plus+trade","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ec4b8942d9d3ddebcfe340291799f934defe1ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,196,184,148,45,157,61,222,188,254,52,2,145,121,159,147,77,239,225,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
