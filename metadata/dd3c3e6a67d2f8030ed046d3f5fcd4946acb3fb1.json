I then wrote a specific kind of narrative about a woman being unfaithful to her husband and nobody had anything scandalous to say about my wife. But I wrote an empathetic sort of tale about some homosexuals and my mailbox filled up with cards drenched with scent and letters written in purple ink with green capitals.&quot;\n\nAnyway, the issue also includes other short fiction from Hugo winners Robert Bloch, Murray Leinster, and Mark Clifton, among others.\n\nI include pdfs of both my original scans and a cleaned-up, high-contrast version that is probably easier to read and to print.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd3c3e6a67d2f8030ed046d3f5fcd4946acb3fb1","amp;dn":"Universe+%231+%28June+1953%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd3c3e6a67d2f8030ed046d3f5fcd4946acb3fb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,60,62,106,103,210,248,3,14,208,70,211,245,252,212,148,106,203,63,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
