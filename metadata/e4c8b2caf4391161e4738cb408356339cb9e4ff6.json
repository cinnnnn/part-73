Malaysian officials are revealing new details and the United States is looking into terror connections and possible threats to national security after the plane went missing more than a week ago. \n\nAlex also looks at the wholesale betrayal of the internet and the web as the Obama administration hands the medium over to the globalists. \n\nAlex provides in-depth analysis of the latest developments in the Ukraine imbroglio as voters head to the polls to decide the fate of Crimea as the United States, the European Union and Russia jostle behind the scenes and troops and hardware are moved into place creating a worrisome scenario for peace and sanity.\n\nWorth a close listen is caller, &quot;Steve from Texas&quot; (retired Naval Intelligence) in the middle of hour two.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
