It was released on 11 September 2000 through London Records. The track was released as the lead single from the group's debut studio album, One Touch, which was released the following year. \nAt the time, the group consisted of SiobhÃƒÂ¡n Donaghy, Mutya Buena and Keisha Buchanan. It was co-produced and co-written by British songwriters and producers Paul Simm, Felix Howard, Jony Rockstar and Cameron McVey.\n\nIt received an overwhelmingly positive reception from music critics. The general theme of the song involves a teenage girl's crush towards a boy and her finding the situation difficult to manage. The song features on the soundtrack to the 2001 film High Heels and Low Lifes, directed by Mel Smith, and the 2002 film 40 Days and 40 Nights, directed by Michael Lehmann. \nThe song was nominated for &quot;Best British Single&quot; at the 2001 BRIT Awards and later inspired the title of the group's greatest hits compilation Overloaded: The Singles Collection. Controversy also surrounded American recording artist Christina Aguilera's song &quot;Make Over&quot; for &quot;borrowing&quot; the sound and concept of &quot;Overload&quot;. Later pressings of Stripped included credits for Buchanan, Buena, Donaghy, Jonathan Lipsey, Felix Howard, Cameron McVey, and Paul Simm.\n\n&quot;Overload&quot; received universal critical acclaim from music critics. NME regarded the song's quality as &quot;hauntingly infectious&quot;, and praised the track as irresistible and radio-friendly. The Portland Mercury also considered the song irresistible, and applauded its &quot;snappy pop harmonies&quot; and &quot;jazzy dance beats&quot;. Sydney Morning Herald called the track &quot;disarmingly sophisticated&quot;. Cameron Adams of Herald Sun wrote that &quot;Overload&quot; is one of the group's &quot;finest moments&quot;, and reflected upon this as to why the song does not resemble those released by other girl groups. The Observer's Kitty Empire called the song a &quot;brilliant&quot; hit with &quot;unexpected class&quot;, and cited it as the starting point of the Sugababes' &quot;course to stardom&quot;.\n\nNick Levine of Digital Spy considered &quot;Overload&quot; one of the best debut singles by a British girl group.\n\nwhilst it also made NME's Year End Top 10 Singles for the year of 2000. Pitchfork included it at #432 on their Top 500 Tracks of the Decade list in 2009. In October 2011, NME placed it at number 51 on its list &quot;150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years&quot;.
