Trained to sing by her soprano mother, Clark embarked on a stage career at the age of seven; soon she was a fixture on British radio programs, and began hosting her own regular show, Pet's Parlour -- a series spotlighting patriotic songs designed to boost the morale of wartime audiences -- at the tender age of 11.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/petula-clark-p3912/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/petula-clark-p3912/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Richie Unterberger):\n\nFour-CD, 80-song box set of Clark's '60s material contains all of her big U.S. and U.K. hits, numerous singles that were only hits in other countries (usually France), and a bunch of interesting covers, B-sides, and LP tracks, some quite rare. If you're enough of a fan to want more than what you'll find on the usual thorough hits anthology, but not enough of a fan to want everything she ever did, this is perfect. It's got all of the classics, serviceable (although not terribly extensive) liner notes, and a host of interesting items that aren't well-known. These include a 1963 version of &quot;Please Please Me&quot; (sung in French) that was most likely one of the very first Lennon-McCartney covers; a French-sung cover of &quot;Nobody I Know,&quot; the Lennon-McCartney tune never done by the Beatles, although Peter &amp; Gordon had a hit with it; the original versions of &quot;I Will Follow Him&quot; (in English and French), covered for a chart-topper by Little Peggy March in the U.S.; yet another French-sung British Invasion cover, of the Kinks' &quot;Well Respected Man,&quot; that was a hit in Canada; and &quot;You're the One&quot; (covered for a hit by the Vogues in the States). Best of all is the mid-'60s B-side &quot;Heart&quot; (covered by the Remains in America), a Clark original that's her hardest-rocking cut, and proof that she could muster the energy to sing rock &amp; roll convincingly on occasion.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-classic-collection-r354338/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-classic-collection-r354338/review&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000024ROK&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000024ROK&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\nDisc 1 - The Singles, Part One:\n\n01.
