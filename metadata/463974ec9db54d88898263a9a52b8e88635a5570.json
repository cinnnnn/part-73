The film stars Rod Cameron, Joanne Dru, John Ireland and John Dehner and Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams. It has also been released under the title: Camels West. It was produced by Edward Small.\nThe picture was originally released in 3-D.\n\nNOT many people are familiar with a fantastic venture that occurred back in 1868 in the American Southwest, when a fellow named Edward Fitzpatrick Beale imported some camels from Arabia and tried to prove that they were the beasts for transport use in the deserts of New Mexico, Arizona and California. Not many people even know itÃ¢â‚¬â€but Harry Essex and Geoffrey Homes do, and they have written a movie that uses this incident for a bit of amusing detail.\n\n&quot;Southwest Passage,&quot; which was delivered to the Palace yesterday, along with eight acts of vaudeville, recollects the expedition of Mr. Beale to survey a route across the desert and prove that camels do better than horses or mules. In a greenish tinge of Pathecolor, it shows the gaunt, lumbering Arabian beasts, handled by burnoosed drivers, all mixed up with a standard western train of cavalry and covered wagons. And this is a very bizarre and funny thing to see.\nThere's still a great chance for somebody to go a little farther and do a real camel-opera.\n\nIn this western, a forward thinking hero joins in on the promotion of camels as the perfect desert pack animals. He embarks upon a journey with a group of others. Among them is a fugitive bankrobber and his girl friend who are trying to outfox a posse. One of the hero's men recognizes the desperado and begins blackmailing him in exchange for silence. During the journey, a band of angry natives attack. Later, the group loses their water and face the prospect of dying of thirst.\n\nNow a bit about Edward Fitzpatrick Beale mentioned above,interesting man this was.\nEdward Fitzgerald &quot;Ned&quot; Beale (February 4, 1822 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ April 22, 1893) was a national figure in 19th century America. He was naval officer, military general, explorer, frontiersman, Indian affairs superintendent, California rancher, diplomat, and friend of Kit Carson, Buffalo Bill Cody and Ulysses S. Grant. He fought in the Mexican-American War, emerging as a hero of the Battle of San Pasqual in 1846. He achieved national fame in 1848 in carrying to the east the first gold samples from California, contributing to the gold rush.\n\nHe surveyed and built a wagon road that many settlers used to move to the West, and which became part of Route 66 and the route for the Transcontinental railroad. As California's first Superintendent of Indian Affairs, Beale helped charter a humanitarian policy towards Native Americans in the 1850s. He also founded the Tejon Ranch in California, the largest private landholding in the United States, and became a millionaire several times over. He received appointments from five U.S. Presidents: Andrew Jackson appointed him to Naval School, Millard Fillmore appointed him Superintendent of Indian Affairs for California and Nevada, James Buchanan appointed him to survey a wagon road from New Mexico to California, Abraham Lincoln appointed him Surveyor General of California and Nevada, and Ulysses S. Grant appointed him Ambassador to AustriaÃ¢â‚¬â€œHungary.\n&quot;Beale successfully pursued a personal El Dorado of adventure, status, and wealth,&quot; wrote Gerald Thompson. &quot;In doing so, he mirrored the dreams of countless Americans of his day.&quot;\nSeems he started what became route 66.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 1.36gb\nDuration.... 01:15:11\nCodec.... divx\nFrame Width..... 640\nFrame Height....464\nData Rate.... 2472kbps\nFrame Rate.... 29F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 133kbps....
