Every episode was fact based and the realism of the show was elevated by the use of actual combat footage from the files of the United States Navy.\n\nThe stories, which varied between the South Pacific during World War II, the Atlantic campaign and the Korean War, were the brainchild of Rear Admiral Thomas M. Dykers, himself a submariner, who retired from the Navy in 1949 after 22 years of service. Admiral Dykers also did an intro piece for each episode, narrated the action and filmed a closing segment, usually with a member of the crew of the submarine that was highlighted on that particular episode.\n\nEach season was comprised of 39 episodes. All of the episodes for season one are complete, however there are three missing episodes for season two. If anyone has copies or knows where they are available, please let me know.\n\nIn addition to the episodes, I&quot;ve included copies of the press kits that were issued to the stations along with the films. I&quot;ve also included episode summaries which are handy in preparing notices / programs for individual viewing.\n\n**********************************************************************************\n\nSeries One\n\nUSS Jack &quot;The Jack at Tokyo&quot;\nUSS Trout &quot;The Trout at Rainbow's End&quot;\nUSS Thresher &quot;The End of the Line&quot;\nUSS Sculpin &quot;The Sculpin Story&quot;\nUSS Spearfish &quot;The Spearfish Delivers&quot;\nUSS Bergall &quot;The Bergall&quot;s Dilemma&quot;\nUSS Batfish &quot;The Batfish Scores&quot;\nUSS Tigrone &quot;Tigrone Sets a Record&quot;\nUSS Gato &quot;Five Ring Circus&quot;\nUSS Pampanito &quot;The Pampanito Story&quot;\nUSS Tirante &quot;Tirante Plays a Hunch&quot;\nUSS Tang &quot;Tang vs. Truk&quot;\nUSS Wahoo &quot;Wahoo's Final Report&quot;\nUSS Dace, USS Darter &quot;Two Davids and Goliath&quot;\nUSS S-38 &quot;The Ordeal of the S-38&quot;\nUSS Seahorse &quot;The Seahorse Story&quot;\nUSS Salmon &quot;The Salmon Swims Upstream&quot;\nUSS Crevalle &quot;Cargo for Crevalle&quot;\nUSS Crevalle &quot;Boomerang&quot;\nUSS Sailfish &quot;The Squailfish&quot;\nUSS Grouper &quot;The Grouper Story&quot;\nUSS Seawolf &quot;The Eyes of the Seawolf&quot;\nUSS Seadragon &quot;The Seadragon Story&quot;\nUSS Narwhal &quot;Narwhal's Passenger From Mindanao&quot;\nUSS Perch &quot;The Perch's New Role&quot;\nUSS Barb &quot;The Final War Patrol&quot;\nUSS Cochino &quot;The Last Dive&quot;\nUSS Gar &quot;The Gar Story&quot;\nUSS Flier &quot;The Flier Story&quot;\nUSS Starfish &quot;The Starfish Came Home&quot;\nUSS Sealion &quot;The Sealion Story&quot;\nUSS Nautilus &quot;The Nautilus Story&quot;\nUSS Harder &quot;Hit &quot;Em Again, Harder&quot;\nUSS Seashark &quot;The Seashark Story&quot;\nMines (9 Sub Wolfpack) &quot;The Tshushima Straits Story&quot;\nUSS Searaven &quot;The Searaven Story&quot;\nUSS Tang &quot;The Loss of the Tang&quot;\nUSS Perch &quot;The Loss of the Perch&quot;\nUSS Guardfish &quot;The Guardfish Story&quot;\nSilent Service Press Kit - Series I (PDF File)\nSilent Service Executive Summary - Series I (PDF File)\n\n**********************************************************************************\n\nSeries Two\n\nUSS Archerfish &quot;The Archerfish Spits Straight&quot;\nUSS Sea Devil &quot;The Sea Devil Attacks Puget Sound&quot;\nUSS Bergall &quot;The Bergall's Revenge&quot;\nUSS S-34 &quot;The Unsuccessful Patrol&quot;\nUSS Aspro &quot;The Aspro Story&quot;\nUSS Thresher &quot;The Thresher Story&quot;\nUSS Nautilus &quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot; Ã‚Â (not available)\nUSS Peto &quot;Peto Plucks Some Chickens&quot;\nUSS S-38 &quot;The S-38 Story&quot;\nUSS Tarpon &quot;Incident Down South&quot;\nUSS Trigger &quot;Mine, for Keeps&quot;\nUSS Baya &quot;Fish Out of Water&quot;\nUSS Cod &quot;Cod's Lost Boarding Party&quot;\nUSS Triton &quot;The Triton's Christmas&quot;\nUSS Hawkbill &quot;The Hawkbill's Revenge&quot;\nTigershark &quot;The Tigershark&quot;\nUSS Cavalla &quot;The Cavalla Story&quot;\nUSS Growler &quot;The Growler's Captain&quot;\nUSS Tinosa &quot;TheUSS Tinosa Story&quot;\nUSS Grayling &quot;The Grayling Story&quot;\nUSS S-44 &quot;The S-44 Story&quot; Ã‚Â (not available)\nUSS Pargo &quot;The Pargo's Lucky Seventh&quot;\nUSS Crevalle &quot;Crevalle's Mine Plant&quot;\nUSS Sunfish &quot;The Sunfish Story&quot;\nUSS Sunfish &quot;The Sunfish's Cook&quot;\nUSS Nautilus &quot;Nautilus and the Nuns&quot;\nSandshark &quot;The Sandshark Story&quot;\nUSS Seadragon &quot;Operation Seadragon&quot;\nUSS Harder &quot;Harder at Woleai&quot;\nUSS Tautog &quot;The Tautog Story&quot;\nUSS Swordfish &quot;The Swordfish Story&quot;\nUSS Gabilan &quot;The Gabilan Story&quot;\nUSS Gato &quot;The Gato Story&quot;\nUSS Silversides &quot;The Silversides Story&quot;\nUSS Bowfin &quot;The Bowfin Story&quot;\nHMS Cobra &quot;Royal Submarines&quot; Ã‚Â Ã‚Â (not available)\nUSS Squalus &quot;The Squalus Story&quot;\nSeanettle &quot;Seanettle Vs.
