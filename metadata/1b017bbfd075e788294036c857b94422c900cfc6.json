Such is the story of General Fieldorf. Fieldorf was hailed as a war hero for his resistance to the Nazis, only to be later vilified by the Communists who took over the country he fought to preserve. Beginning with his exploits during the war and ending with his eventual execution, the story exhibits a family man who always maintained his principals and wouldn't allow political corruption to sway him. Tragically, it was his faith in humankind that kept him from believing his own countrymen could be capable of the monstrosities he defended them from. Director: Ryszard Bugajski.
