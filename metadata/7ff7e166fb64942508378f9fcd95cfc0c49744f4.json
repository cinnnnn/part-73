His performances of the Eighth have received fervent as well as somewhat cooler praise (music critics are a hard lot to please). Yet he has performed more Bruckner than just the Eighth. To his credit are various recordings, many no longer available, of all Bruckner's symphonies, with the possible exception of No. 00. After repeatedly listening to this recording of the Fifth Symphony with the Vienna Philharmonic, I am surprised that it doesn't appear to be as well-known as it should be. Recorded by Decca in 1974, it was internationally released on CD 30 years later under the Eloquence label (Australia). It's now been available for six years, and deserves recognition.\n\nBruckner's Fifth is one of his best. Though it differs from other Bruckner symphonies in beginning with a slow introduction, and uniquely blends sonata form and fugue in the last movement, it bears all the Bruckner trademark features. The huge climaxes are there; the pauses are there; tension is maintained by alternating soft and loud, idyllic and dramatic passages; it includes a substantial adagio movement; the finale quotes themes from previous movements; and it concludes with a glorious, overpowering coda. Furtwangler thought the finale was &quot;the most monumental movement in the entire symphonic literature.&quot; Bruckner himself called it his &quot;contrapuntal masterpiece.&quot;\n\nCurrently, many different recordings of the symphony are available, going in total playing time from a fast driving 70 minutes to an expansive 83.
