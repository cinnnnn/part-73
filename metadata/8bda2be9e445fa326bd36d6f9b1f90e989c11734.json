The latter two characters feature during the series' first five episodes. However, they depart in the fifth episode, after which both Gillan and Darvill left the show and were replaced by Jenna-Louise Coleman, portraying Clara Oswald. The 2012 Christmas Special introduces a new TARDIS interior, title sequence, theme tune, and costume for the Doctor. Clara Oswald joins him for the second half of the series.\n\nIf you've already got any of the previous episodes I've uploaded then this will go much faster.\n\nFormatted to work on iPods.\n\n701 - Asylum of the Daleks ................. 48:27\n702 - Dinosaurs on a Spaceship ............. 44:58\n703 - A Town Called Mercy .................. 44:13\n704 - The Power of Three ................... 41:09\n705 - The Angels Take Manhattan ............ 44:14\n7CS - The Snowmen .......................... 59:41\n706 - The Bells of Saint John .............. 45:05\n707 - The Rings of Akhaten ................. 43:18\n708 - Cold War ............................. 40:53\n709 - Hide ................................. 44:16\n710 - Journey To The Centre Of The Tardis .. 44:17\n711 - The Crimson Horror ................... 44:10\n712 - Nightmare In Silver .................. 44:05\n713 - The Name Of The Doctor ............... 44:15","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bda2be9e445fa326bd36d6f9b1f90e989c11734","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+Series+7+-+iPod+Compatible","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bda2be9e445fa326bd36d6f9b1f90e989c11734","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,218,43,233,228,69,250,50,107,211,109,111,155,31,144,233,137,193,23,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
