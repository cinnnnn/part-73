Intense scrutiny is devoted to the pattern of physical    \n   (including isotopic), sedimentary and biotic circumstances through the    \n   time intervals during which life crises occurred. These events affected   \n   terrestrial, lacustrine and estuarine ecosystems, locally and globally,   \n   but have affected continental shelf ecosystems and even deep ocean        \n   ecosystems. The pattern of these events is the backdrop against which     \n   modelling the pattern of future environmental change needs to be          \n   evaluated.                                                                \n\n  +-[ ALEXANDRIA ]----------------------------------------------------------+\n  : The Royal Library of Alexandria, or Ancient Library of Alexandria, in   :\n  : Alexandria, Egypt, was the largest and most significant great library   :\n  : of the ancient world.
