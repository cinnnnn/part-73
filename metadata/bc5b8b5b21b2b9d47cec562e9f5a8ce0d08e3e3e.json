Everyone in the village knows that father and son are at loggerheads. Shyamlal is also an eccentric who eschews anything modern. Then, instead of Shyamlal, his son Jiban Mallik is killed and the wealth of the Mallik's looted. Oddly though, the dead body of Jiban Mallik vanishes, only to reappear again. What actually happened? Who is the criminal? Feluda works this out with a mixture of investigative skills and deception..\n\nJoto Kando Kathmandute: \n\n\tA gentleman called Mr. Batra comes to Feluda to say that someone is impersonating him. Another client, Anikendra Shome, is murdered, ostensibly by Batra's lookalike. The leads point towards Kathmandu and the three musketeers have to go there. In Kathmandu Feluda meets up with his old foe Maganlal Meghraj. What is Meghraj up to this time, apart from tormenting Jatayu? And what role does the famous doctor, Dibakar have to play in the whole affair? It is up to Feluda to uncover the truth about Meghraj once again...\n\nEkei Bole Shooting:\n\n\tThe making of Feluda 30. Or more correctly snippets from the shootings. Did you know that Sabyasachi filmed a scene in Gosaipur Sorgorom with a broken foot and in bandages? that he also ran a 100 yards with that broken foot? or that one scene of a few seconds in Baksho Rahossyo was shot partly in Shimla and partly in Sikkim? Watch this episode to see these and other incidents...\n\n\n\nComments:\n---------\n\nThe second of the two disc AVCHD uploads of Feluda 30. This set has three interesting little bits that I must share with you. \n\nFirst, &quot;Joto Kando Kathmandute&quot; is the only Feluda film that has been made in Hindi as well. It was called &quot;Kissa Kathmandu Ka&quot; with Shashi Kapoor playing Feluda. That is surprising, given that the English translation and compilation of the Feluda books is also a best seller. Perhaps it is because Sandip Ray does not sell the film rights of Satyajit Rays books, fearing what the Hindi Film makers would do with Feluda.\n\nSecond, Both Robi Ghosh &amp; Anupkumar played Jatayu in just two films each. Each disc in this collection has one film of Robi Ghosh and one of Anupkumar. Incidentally both died soon after they played their second role...\n\nThird, Feluda went abroad for the first time in &quot;Joto Kando Kathmandute&quot;... Later of course he was to go to many cities that Satyajit loved. Interestingly, Feluda started out as the son of the Maternal Uncle of Topshe in his first story (Darjeeling Jomjomat) and Topshe was Topesh Ranjan Bose. Fromthe secod story onwards, Feluda became the first cousin on Topshe's father's side and that is what he consistently remained ever after... \n\n This completes the AVCHD uploads of Feluda 30. We will also upload all six films in AVC/X264/MKV format, but the MKV uploads will not have the Menu(s) described below.\n\n\n\nUploader's Notes:\n-----------------\n\nThe Menus:\n\nFirst about the menu. It is in two parts. The Wecome menu consists of the welcome scene from some of the Feluda 30 films and the second part is from Royal Bengal Rahossyo. Both these video clips have been seamlessly added to each other and some animation (like the gun shooting the film posters) added as are the Bengali letters for 30. The music is from Feluda 30.\n\nThe main menu background has the ribbons first seen in Satyajit Ray Presents. To this we have added the images of Feluda and Topshe. The images of the two actors who played Jatayu (Robi Ghosh &amp; Anup Kumar) altrnate, keeping the threesome intact at all times. Some additional animation helps to spice up the menu. The music is the Feluda theme from Sonar Kella.\n\nThe two menus are in 1080p (1920x1080) size. Both are animated.\n\nHow To Play:\n\nOffline: This is a AVCHD rip with the three parts organised and a menu added in a Blu-Ray format. To play from a DVD disc, use any burning software such as ImgBurn to write the entire AVCHD folder to a 8.5 GB DVD disc. You can then play it on any player that is AVCHD compatible (all blu-ray players are). It works on my Phlips player.\n\nOn your PC: If you don't have a Blu-Ray player, you can watch the movie on your PC.  It will not fully play on VLC or any ordinary player. To play this please download a Blu-Ray player software. I recommend Nero Blu-Ray player which plays it perfectly. Just drag and drop the AVCHD folder into Nero Blu-Ray Player.\n\nIf you insist on using your existing software, you can do it still. Just open the folders until you reach the sub-folder called 'STREAM'. There you will find five files. 00000.MTS is GGBB; 00001.MTS is HRD and 00003.MTS is GBFE; 01200.MTS is the Welcome Menu and 01201.MTS is the main Menu. Each will individually play in VLC or MPC etc. But the menus will not respond to mouse clicks on its buttons.\n\n\n\nIMDB Link:\n----------\nNot available...\n\nRipper:\n-------\ndebpk77","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc5b8b5b21b2b9d47cec562e9f5a8ce0d08e3e3e","amp;dn":"Feluda.30-AVCHD+rip-.BEN.Esubs+-+AC3.720p+-+DISC-2-%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc5b8b5b21b2b9d47cec562e9f5a8ce0d08e3e3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,91,139,91,33,178,185,212,124,236,86,46,159,90,140,224,208,142,62,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
