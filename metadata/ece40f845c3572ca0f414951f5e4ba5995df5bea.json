It has bred perhaps the most enduring Australian icon Ã‚â€“ the digger. This is his story.\n\nThrough a sequence of pivotal battles we tell the story of the Digger Ã‚â€“ the legend, the myth and the truth. The emergence of a type of fighting man with an international reputation as non-conformist, disrespectful, loose of discipline and unparalleled as a shock troop or as a soldier able to function on his own initiative.\n\nArchive, re-enactment, expert commentary and visits to the worldwide scenes of the chosen events combine with selected first person accounts, by ordinary soldiers, to chart the emergence of a national icon.\n\nBattle Camp in Far North Queensland was the scene of a pitched battle during the Ã‚â€œfrontier warsÃ‚â€ when those firing their Schneider rifles at the attacking Aboriginals were not yet soldiers, or even Australians.\n\nIn South Africa they had become soldiers but were still not Australians when they fought the Boers. At the Siege of Elands River they wrote the story of the first heroic action into the long record of AustraliaÃ‚â€™s military achievements.\n\nGallipoli may be where popular legend has it that Australia grew to nationhood, but her young men became hardened and redoubtable soldiers Ã‚â€“ Ã‚â€œdiggersÃ‚â€ Ã‚â€“ on the Western Front, where they were blooded at a place called Fromelles.\n\nOnly twenty-five years later the legend of the digger grew almost to maturity in the Pacific War, in battles such as Milne Bay.\n\nThe greatest international honour ever paid to Australian fighting soldiers, the American Presidential Citation, was awarded for action in the Korean War, at the Battle of Kapyong.\n\nLess than a hundred years separate Battle Camp from Long Tan in Vietnam. Less than half a century divides that battle from the image which brings our history of the digger up to date Ã‚â€“ East Timor, the professional, international soldier acting wholly under Australian command.\n\nThis is a story full of high drama, diverse landscape, terrible and funny stories and fascinating characters. At its core is one of the central elements of AustraliaÃ‚â€™s cultural identity, The Digger.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img339.imageshack.us/img339/541/thediggerscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img339.imageshack.us/img339/541/thediggerscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img843.imageshack.us/img843/7871/thediggerscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img843.imageshack.us/img843/7871/thediggerscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/5945/thediggerscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/5945/thediggerscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img268.imageshack.us/img268/885/thediggerscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img268.imageshack.us/img268/885/thediggerscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img202.imageshack.us/img202/1936/thediggerscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img202.imageshack.us/img202/1936/thediggerscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img202.imageshack.us/img202/4586/thediggerscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img202.imageshack.us/img202/4586/thediggerscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: x264 ,AVC-1\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 20\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio BitRate: 192 kbps\nAudio Streams: 2.0\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 82 min\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 2.06 GB\nRipped by Hukumuzuku\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Gallipoli&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Gallipoli&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Australian%20War%20Experience&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Australian%20War%20Experience&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Australians%20at%20War&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Australians%20at%20War&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  ed2k Links \n\n\n&quot;ed2k://|file|The.Digger.HDTV.x264.720p.AC3.MVGroup.org.mkv|2222572666|b29d373f77e708565538162bd589b568|/&quot;\n\n\n\n\nAdded by &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=User%3AHukumuzuku&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=User%3AHukumuzuku&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSource: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=The_Digger&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=The_Digger&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ece40f845c3572ca0f414951f5e4ba5995df5bea","amp;dn":"The+Digger+x264+720p+AC3+HDTV+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ece40f845c3572ca0f414951f5e4ba5995df5bea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,228,15,132,92,53,114,202,15,65,73,81,245,228,186,89,149,223,91,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
