Such dogmas are not only limiting, but dangerous for the future of humanity.\n\nAccording to these principles, all of reality is material or physical; the world is a machine, made up of inanimate matter; nature is purposeless; consciousness is nothing but the physical activity of the brain; free will is an illusion; God exists only as an idea in human minds, imprisoned within our skulls.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74a0de58cd1784265dfa9e74040070283266fef6","amp;dn":"Science+Set+Free%3A+10+Paths+to+New+Discovery+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74a0de58cd1784265dfa9e74040070283266fef6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,160,222,88,205,23,132,38,93,250,158,116,4,0,112,40,50,102,254,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
