It is a good choice for library collections.\nEach section of this book could have a different audience. There is useful advice on using chess computers, explanations of ratings, clarifications of tournament rules, descriptions of timing options, and more.\nOne section which stands out is the one on Openings. It explains practical openings in words and gives illustrative games.\nThe information here is generally superior to Pandolfini's book on chess trivia, but it can be hard to locate. This is really a book for browsing. It is very readable. \n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Lalic_susan_bcc2011.jpg/220px-Lalic_susan_bcc2011.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Lalic_susan_bcc2011.jpg/220px-Lalic_susan_bcc2011.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nSusan (born Walker) (born 28 October 1965) is an English chess player, holding both International Master and Woman Grandmaster titles.
